### Description

This spell enables the caster to harness a nonmagical wind and change its force by one rank, as shown on Table 79, "Weather Conditions," in the DMG. For example, "becalmed" conditions (those found on a still day) can be become a light breeze. And a light breeze either can be diminished to becalmed conditions or increased to a favourable wind. The spell works equally well in an enclosed area, such as a dungeon, where "wind conditions" are considered becalmed.

Wizards who are levels 9 and under can modify only natural winds of storm force or less. They can increase a storm-force wind to gale-force, but cannot affect an existing gale-force wind. At 10th level, a wizard can alter gale-force winds, and at 15th level, he can reduce hurricane-force winds.

The change caused by this spell is immediate, with the area of effect centred on the caster. He can alter the wind only once (which means by one level only). As long as a wind is shaped by this spell, subsequent alter wind spells cannot affect the same area. Other magics that change wind or weather can affect an altered wind, however. When the alter wind spell ends, the air returns to its original state.

Alter wind has no effect on creatures of elemental air. Nor does it affect creatures that use air in their attacks. The wind cannot deflect an enemy’s breath weapon and send it back toward the attacker, for example. However, alter wind does enable the caster to move nonmagical fog, dust, or poisonous gas out of his way, negating its effects for 1d6 rounds.

The material component of this spell is a small silver tube, through which the caster blows to attract the wind’s attention.
