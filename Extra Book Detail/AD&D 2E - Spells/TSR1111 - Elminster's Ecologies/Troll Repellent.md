### Description

This spell creates a thin, greasy, greenish mist that carries a potent odour. While this odour is unpleasant to most creatures, it is horrible to trolls, and if they fail their saving throw at +4, they leave the area of the mist for the duration of the spell, refusing to enter again until it is gone.

The mist, unfortunately, is easily dispersed, making it useless in even a light breeze. The spellcaster must concentrate during the duration of the spell, or the mist instantly disperses. The material components for this spell are a bit of ragweed, some troll dung, and an open flame.
