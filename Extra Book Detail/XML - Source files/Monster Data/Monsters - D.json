"MonDescription": [
"These creatures of Hades are servants of Myrkul, brought to the Realms by the magic he placed on his Tablet of Fate.",
"Each denizen was once a living being, usually a cleric of Myrkul. Evil and cunning in life, they were rewarded in death with these new forms and the role of tormentors of the dead.",
"There are many kinds of denizens, with many different powers and proficiencies. This entry describes the two seen in Waterdeep during the Time of Troubles: knights and dukes. In the ability listings above, some entries have two values, separated by slashes. The number before the slash indicates knights; the number after, dukes.",
"Knights have grotesque, casklike bodies with gangly, misshapen arms that drag along the ground. Their short legs bely their speed and grace. Knights have humanlike heads and features, except for bilious fangs and glowing red eyes. They speak in low, guttural voices.",
"Dukes have fat bodies covered with feathers. Their huge, leathery wings propel them through air at maneuverability class C. A duke's head looks like nothing human, but rather a combination of vampiric fangs, insectile compound eyes, and a flat hoglike snout. Both hair and quills grow on its head, just behind a pair of diminutive horns.",
"<h2>Combat:</h2>",
"Denizens have several special abilities that only function in their home plane of Hades, or near an open portal to Hades. They cannot be harmed by less than than +1 magical weapons; they have magic resistance and innate protection from good; and they are immune to the same attacks as undead creatures.",
"All denizens regenerate 1 hp of damage each round. All have infravision (60' range) and extraordinarily acute senses of smell and taste. Some denizens also have other special abilities.",
"However, no denizen can turn invisible, and none can leave the plane of Hades without Myrkul's assistance.",
"When stranded in another dimension without an open gate to Hades within 100 miles, denizens lose their special abilities (except their superhuman senses). They regenerate only 1 hp per day. All attacks can harm them, except for fire- or heat-based attacks. They have no other special defenses. Dukes in flight drop from manoeuvrability class C to class D.",
"In combat denizens attack viciously, picking off the weakest opponents first. They take sadistic pleasure in inflicting pain.",
"Use the first XP value given above for denizens without their special abilities; the XP value in parentheses applies to denizens with all abilities intact.",
"<h2>Habitat/Society:</h2>",
"Denizens are found only in Hades, specifically in the Realm of the Dead (Myrkul's domain). They often fly out over the Fugue Plain of Hades to harvest the waiting souls of the False and Faithless.",
"Denizens belong to an elaborate social structure modelled on human aristocracies. Low-ranking denizens are called 'knights'; those of greater power have titles such as 'duke' or 'prince.' All obey Lord Myrkul without question. It is not clear whether a denizen can voluntarily advance in social status.",
"<h2>Ecology:</h2>",
"Denizens do not need to eat to survive, but they enjoy the taste of living flesh."
