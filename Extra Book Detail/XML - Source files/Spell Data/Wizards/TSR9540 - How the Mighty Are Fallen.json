   "SpellDescription": [
   "The <em>tracer</em> spell was designed by a bounty-hunting arcanist who was tired of running into a mark and having them escape at the last second, only to have to hunt them down again. The spell he designed allowed him to spot a target and place a dweomer on the victim. Once the <em>tracer</em> was set, Chevic was able to teleport to within 10 feet of the victim in order to try and bring the criminal in to face justice.",
   "Up to one <em>tracer</em> can be placed on the victim for every five levels of the spell caster. By simply willing it, the arcanist is able to \"break\" the <em>tracer</em>, freeing up a spell for yet another bounty target. The spell requires vocal components as well as a cube of lodestone."
