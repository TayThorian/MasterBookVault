"Created by the famous Fathomer Laurish Samprey, Samprey's Sensible Sea Sphere projects a bubble of oxygen-similar to that generated by an airy water spell-around the head of the enchanted creature. This localized bubble of oxygen effectively acts as a helm of underwater action, allowing the recipient to breathe normally, cast spells, and hear as an assisted creature while submerged in water.",
"Casters can use this spell on unwilling creatures (usually those that exclusively breathe water) by making an attack roll; success indicates that the caster in question places the spell's material component (see below) around the head of the target creature. However, these creatures are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell which, if successful, negates the dweomer. Creatures of animal intelligence (1) or less who cannot breathe air will swirl about wildly and suffer 1d6 points of damage per round while the spell is in effect. Water-breathers possessing greater-than-animal intelligence immediately attempt to remove the material component from around their necks.",
"The material component of this spell is a scale from a member of an intelligent aquatic race, which the caster must obtain freely from the appropriate creature. The recipient of the spell must hang this scale around its neck by a necklace fashioned from unblemished sea kelp. This spell ends immediately if the recipient removes the material component from around its neck."

"This spell attunes the recipient to the presence of electrical fields within its radius, granting him the ability to sense the presence of other creatures. This electrical sense allows the recipient to \"see\" the general size and position (though not the race) of all creatures within the area of effect. The spell is highly useful in underwater situations where visibility is sometimes poor or nonexistent.",
"The recipient's electrical sense negates the effects of invisibility, magically induced darkness, and poor visibility on melee attacks in most cases (see Table 72 in the DUNGEON MASTERÂ® Guide).",
"This spell cannot detect the presence of creatures without a central nervous system, such as undead, oozes, slimes, and jellies. In addition, the recipient's extreme sensitivity to electrical fields renders him particularly vulnerable to powerful electric discharges- like those emitted from a lightning bolt or chain lightning spell or an electric eel.",
"If such a discharge occurs within the radius of the spell, the recipient must make a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or be stunned for 1d10 rounds. Stunned characters cannot make any meaningful actions and will sink (or rise) at the appropriate rate for their encumbrance levels (see page 76). If the recipient is actually subjected to an electrical attack, he suffers the attack's normal effects in addition to stunning."

The spell does nothing for beings that breathe underwater by artificial or magical means, nor does it affect those who merely use water- based spells, including most wizards.",
"Because most effects of this spell are beneficial, many recipients waive their saving throws. All recipients gain a +1 bonus to their attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. If damage inflicted by a creature is measured by a number of dice, then the DM should add +1 to each die before making any other modification.",

In addition, creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Water subtract 1 hit point from each Hit Die.
