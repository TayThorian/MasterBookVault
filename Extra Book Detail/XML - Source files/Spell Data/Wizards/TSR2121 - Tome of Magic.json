   "In all cases, simply knowing the proper formula does not mean the wizard can successfully create the item or material. The construction of alchemical mixtures and magical items is a time-consuming and expensive undertaking.",

Reusable magical items must make a saving throw vs.disintegration. If the saving throw is failed, Alamir's fundamental breakdown releases the magic of the item in an explosive blast, rendering it permanently nonmagical. The caster suffers 4d8 points of damage from the explosion.",

    "Hornung, one of the leading wizards in the field of wild magic (before his untimely disappearance while experimenting with wildwind ), developed this spell to improve the accuracy of his estimates.

    "The spell's area of effect is one group of a general class of objects. All objects of the group must be within spell range and the group as a whole must be visible to the caster. The wizard need not see every individual in the group, merely the general limits of the group's size and area. For example, a wizard on a hill could look down on a forest and estimate the number of trees in all or part of it. He could not get an estimate of the number of goblins within the forest, however, since the group as a whole (the goblins) is concealed from sight.",
    "The estimate generated is accurate to the largest factor of ten (rounded up). For example, if Hornung's guess were cast on a group of 439 horsemen, the estimate would be 400. If there were 2,670 horsemen, the spell would estimate 3,000. If there were 37 horsemen, the answer would be 40. Clearly, using the spell on small groups (especially those with fewer than 10 members) is pointless.",

    "Before casting the spell, the mage announces the spell effect he is trying to create. The mage must be able to cast the spell (i.e., have it in his spell books), but need not have it memorized. After announcing the spell (along with the target and any other conditions required by the spell), the wild mage casts Nahal's reckless dweomer. A burst of magical energy is released, which the wild mage tries to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is rolled randomly on Table 2: Wild Surge Results.",
    "Because the release of energy is planned by the mage, his level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result may be beneficial to the mage or it may be completely disastrous; this is the risk the mage takes in casting Nahal's reckless dweomer."

    "Patternweave allows the caster to make sense of apparent chaos. The caster can see such things as pottery shards reformed into a whole pot, shreds of paper formed into a page, scattered parts as a working machine, or specific trails appearing out of overlapping footprints.",
    "After casting the spell, the mage studies seemingly random elements--broken bits of glass, shreds of paper, intermingled trails, etc. The items to be studied must be tangible--coded flashing lights, garbled speech, or thoughts of any kind cannot be studied.",
    "The wizard must study the random elements for one round, after which the DM secretly makes a saving throw vs. spell for the wizard. If the saving throw is failed, the spell fails. However, if the saving throw is successful, the caster sees in his mind the pattern these objects form. If the items studied are truly random, no information is gained.",
    "After the caster has visualized the pattern, he can attempt to reassemble the parts into their original form. This requires another saving throw vs. spell to determine whether the mage remembers sufficient details to accomplish the task. The amount of time required and the quality of restoration vary according to the complexity of the pattern. Reassembling a shredded map may be easy; reassembling a broken clock is significantly more difficult; rebuilding a shattered mosaic is extremely difficult. In any case, the wizard can make only a reasonable copy of the item. He can use this spell to restore works of art, but they will be worth only a small percentage of their original value.",
    "The material component is a small hand lens through which the caster studies the objects. The lens is not consumed in the casting."

The spectral steed flies at a movement rate of 4 per level of the caster, to a maximum movement rate of 48. It appears with a bit and bridle, plus one saddle per passenger.",
 "All normal animals shun the spectral steed and only monsters will attack it. The mount has AC 2 and 10 hit points plus 1 hit point per level of the caster. If it loses all of its hit points, the spectral steed disappears. It has no attack mode.",
 "The material component is a hollow bone from a vulture's wing, which must be carved into a whistle and blown when the spell is cast."
