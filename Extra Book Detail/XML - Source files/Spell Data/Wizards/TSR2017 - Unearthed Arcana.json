   "SpellDescription": [
   "Only persons (cf. charm person: human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller) in their natural form are affected by this spell. The run spell enables the person to run at twice normal speed, up to a movement rate of 24. This pace can be maintained for 5 to 8 hours without tiring. However, after so running the individual must spend a like number of hours resting, as well as drinking plenty of liquids and eating heartily.",
   "For every 2 levels of experience of the spellcaster, another person can be affected: at 4th level, 2 persons can be empowered to run; at 6th level, 3 persons; etc. The spell is mostly used for quick travel by messengers, scouts, and others who must travel far and quickly. Generally, it increases a day's foot travel rate by 70% to 100%.",
   "The material component of this spell is an elixir made of spring water and the oil of 5 to 8 beans of a spurge (caster oil) plant."
