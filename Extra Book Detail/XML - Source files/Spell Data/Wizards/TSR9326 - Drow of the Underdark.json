    "This little-known spell is a weaker version of the death link spell (detailed in the Forgotten Realms Adventures source-book). It affects only priests, wizards, and other beings who cast spells (as opposed to those who exercise spell-like natural powers requiring neither study nor material components). If cast on non-spellcasters, it is wasted (unless they are under the effects of an imbue with spell ability spell).",
    "The backlash spell leaves only a faint dweomer, waiting inactive for later triggering. It cannot be removed by a dispel magic, but will be ended by a remove curse or more powerful spell.",
    "An emplaced backlash takes effect only when the victim first employs an offensive spell that failsâ€”i.e., interrupted or incorrect spellcasting, a successful saving throw, or a target's magic resistance or immunity. Consequently, this spell's effects may occur hours or years after its casting.",
    "The backlash causes the spell to work with full effect on the caster of the failed spell. It negates any saving throws or immunities that would normally apply.",
    "A backlash only works once. Any number of these spells may be placed on a single spellcaster; only one will take effect at a time, the earliest-placed being triggered first. Rumours persist of certain drow wizards who have developed fifth level backlash spells that last for a random number (probably 2-5) of spell failures. Other types may be triggered only by certain sorts of spells (schools, levels, or involving particular elements, such as flight/air or fire)."

If walls have spells upon them, consider them magical barriers (see above).",

    "The wings allow the affected being to fly clumsily (MV Fl 17 (D)), but with great power. With these wings, a being can slow a fall, carry companions or gear of up to twice his normal body weight, or glide to bring up to three times the winged being's normal body weight to a harmless landing.",
    "In flight, the wings can buffet other creatures for 2d4 damage per round (slowing movement to 7 per round), and can be used to shield the winged creature and others, giving them the wings' AC of 4 if desired. The wings can take any amount of damage without collapsing or harming their owner. They slow walking movement rate to a maximum of 7,however, dragging behind the being on which they have grown. They cannot be removed before the spell expires, even by the caster, without the use of dispel magic or poly morph magics."

(A dispel magic will be effective only if cast within 2 rounds of the touch that confers the death spider condition.) The afflicted limb may be severed and burned to destroy the death spider. If done within a round of its creation, only a hand or foot will be lost (with accompanying 1 d4 + 1 hp, System Shock roll, and loss of the limb's mobility and abilities). If left until longer, the entire limb will have to go, with the loss of 1 d 12 + 4 hp and a System Shock Roll.",

A dispel magic spell ends the effects of a hand of darkness, but will also destroy any magical light that it was masking. Continual light or \"at will\" radiances such as glowing magical swords are negated for 1 round/level of the caster of the dispel.",

Creatures can hang onto it, ropes can be tied to or hooked over it (appearing to hang from empty air), and so on. It supports loads of up to 700 pounds.",

Two rounds before it expires, a skyhook warns its caster of impending collapse by fading into invisibility from the caster's gaze.",
    "A skyhook is too small to be stood upon (i.e. to cast spells or fire missile weapons from, or serve as a perch from which to climb further), but its hook is large enough to provide purchase for thick cables or up to six pairs of grasping hands.",
    "A skyhook can be destroyed by its caster (in 1 segment) by willing it out of existence, but the caster need not concentrate on it to maintain it. A skyhook saves vs. a dispel magic cast against it as if it were the caster, and gets a + 4 bonus. It saves as the caster (no bonus) against a disintegrate spell, and can readily be destroyed by a properly-directed limited wish or more powerful spells.",
    "The material component of this spell is a miniature metal fishhook (or metal hook of any size or type; in a pinch, a piece of metal crudely bent into a hookbend can be used). The spell is known to drow, dwarves, human miners and warriors as an aid in climbing, or the placing of temporary supports when bridging chasms, crossing large subterranean caverns near the ceiling, and scaling cliffs and fortress walls."
