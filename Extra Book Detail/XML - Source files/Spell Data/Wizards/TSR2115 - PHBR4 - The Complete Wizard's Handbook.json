Otherwise, the color of the orb determines the amount of damage inflicted and its special power, as summarized on Table 16; details about the special powers are listed below. The caster can create a single orb of any color listed for his level or lower; for instance, a 3rd-level wizard can create an orange, red, or white orb.

Other iron objects within 3 feet of the caster will stick tight to the magnetized armor; only dispel magic or a similar spell can release the stuck items.

When the invisible mail has absorbed as many hit points of damage as the wizard has levels of experience, the invisible mail disappears. The invisible mail does not hinder movement, nor does it add weight or encumbrance. It does not interfere with spell casting.",
  "Example: A wizard with a normal AC of 10 has shielded himself with invisible mail. The first opponent attacks with a normal dagger; the attack is made against the AC 3 of the invisible mail. The attack is successful, causing 2 hit points of damage, but this damage is absorbed by the invisible mail and the wizard is unharmed. A second attack is made with a sword +1. The invisible armor offers no protection against this magical weapon, so the attack is made against the wizard's normal AC of 10.",
