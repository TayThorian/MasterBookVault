    "BookDescription": [
      "Three hundred years from now, humanity is claiming worlds far from Earth. Despite nearly destroying itself in the Twilight War, despite all the wars since, humanity has held on and kept its dream alive. 2300AD is the story of that dream, as humanity reaches for the stars.",
      "This is a richly-developed hard science fiction universe, with ships spinning against the night as they are propelled by the stutterwarp drive, a true violation of physics as we know now it. Airships, helicopters and hovercraft are common sights on worlds of the frontier, while spaceplanes and rockets carry explorers and traders to orbit, and from there starships take them across the gulf of space to the colonies.",
      "Campaigns in 2300AD range from interstellar exploration and war on the far frontier, building new colonies on hostile worlds, discovering and understanding alien species, and engaging in espionage and crime in the gritty mega-cities of the Core worlds.",
      "The 2300AD box set contains:",
      "Book 1 Characters & Equipment: Everything you need to create explorers, company agents, military personnel, merchants and other inhabitants of 2300AD. This book also contains a comprehensive equipment guide, personal augmentations, and a selection of robots and drones commonly used in space and on colony worlds.",
      "Book 2 The Worlds of 2300AD: An exploration of the universe of 2300AD, from the Core worlds to the furthest colonies. You will learn about the aliens and animals that inhabit them, how humanity has adapted to living on their surfaces, and the most hostile of environmental threats to be found beyond the Earth.",
      "Book 3 Vehicles & Spacecraft: A full guide to operating and fighting in spacecraft and vehicles, from humble dirt bikes to powerful spacegoing frigates. There is also a glimpse at the alien spacecraft that have been encountered thus far by humanity.",
      "Starchart of Known Space: A massive poster map depicting every star system known to humanity and the routes starships take to each."

  "BookDescription": [
    "Aerospace engineering is the art and science of designing spacecraft and starships. This practice encompasses a range of craft from sleek surface-to-orbit craft to lumbering bulk carriers, and the aerospace engineer is key to their design.",
    "Spacecraft and starships are the lifeblood of exploration and commerce. They are also vital in the defence and acquisition of colony worlds and the economies that rely on them. The stutterwarp drive provides the key to interstellar travel. Rather than taking decades or even centuries to reach the stars, stutterwarp reduces that time to days. The most difficult part remains escaping a planetary gravity well; once in orbit, you are halfway to anywhere.",
    "The Aerospace Engineers’ Handbook provides everything you need to design not just the ships of human space, but also the vessels of the alien Kaefers, Pentapods, and Sung. It also covers the design of drones, space stations, and alternative means of achieving orbit.",
    "Alongside this, there is further information on those living in space, the outsiders who abandoned planets for the stars, along with the major space powers and their fleets. The Aerospace Engineers’ Handbook also contains a selection of drones and ships, for Travellers to command, fight, or run away from, with advanced rules for spacecraft combat."

    "In order to connect all those worlds with the systems of the Core, starships are required. Interface craft are required to connect the great ships with the worlds below, other ships are need to find raw materials, and to find new worlds. And still other are required to protect all those other ships and the worlds they serve.",
    "This book contains many drones, fighters, freighters, landers and warships from across human space, along with a selection of ships used by the three space-faring alien species at the edge of human space: the Pteranodon-like Sung; the odd little biotech masters, the Pentapods; and the hulking, vaguely-insectoid Kaefers, unrelentingly-hostile and bent on conquest.",
    "The 81 ships, drones, modules and stations in this volume build on the ships presented in 2300AD, and add new opportunities for trade, diplomacy, exploration, and combat."

Explorers fight uncharted systems on the Frontier. Colonists fight hostile environments on strange worlds. And nations fight each other for political power to determine who will lead the human race in the struggle to tame the universe. You can be part of this new gae in 2300 AD - the state-of-the-art in science-fiction role playing.",
    "2300 AD plays against a background of Earth and its colonies 300 years after the cataclysm of the World War III, The Twilight War. Set in a world where nations still clash, civilization has crawled back to its pre-war levels, and then beyond. The world is dominated by the Third French Empire, which maintains a shaky peace among its jealous rivals.. Earth's hundred nations have colonies among the stars. First contact happened long ago, and commerce with aliens in now commonplace.",
    "Civilization has flowered to a point undreamed of earlier, but worms are at the blossoms core. One alien race, the Kafers, is bent on eradicating humanity. Anarchists labor to bring Earth's rule crashing down. Smugglers transport alien products to other worlds, thoughtless of ecological effects. Pirates prey on merchant and colonization vessels.",

    "Game Systems",
    "Playable realism. Many games which are realistic cannot be played; most playable systems aren't terribly realistic. 2300 AD is both at once, balancing detail with simple, accurate game systems.",
    "The heart of 2300 AD is its task resolution system. Rules covers all aspects of conflict resolution, from creating new scientific equipment to flying starships to running group combat. Clean but detailed rules also cover player character generation and experience, starship operations and combat, star system and world generation, and non-player character skills and motivations (including six different alien races), making 2300 AD the state-of-the-art in science-fiction role playing.",

But the rest of the wrlds within a star system can have a great impact upon the colny and may even have been the original impetus for human settlement. This section describes the primary or primaries of the system, and its family of planetery bodies, some of which are quite valuable to the human effort in distant soace.",
    "Plantary Data: Every planet has its own unique charater. Some planets are tectonically active, while others are more stable, or are manipulated by nearby gavity wells or recent meteor impacts. Nearly all the colony worlds have their own biosphere, evolved individually on the worlds to create a variety of life forms, most of which are still barely understood. Form the great silted seas of Botany Bay to the Eber ruins of Beta Hydri, each of Earth's colory worlds offers a wealth of unique characteristics for exploration and adventure.",
    "olonial Data: Man has travelled to the stars and settled the more hospitable planets but failed to leave balkanization behind. More than a dozen of Earth's nations have established off-world colonies, many sharing planets under the protection of the Melbourne Accords. Some generalizations apply, as exemplified by the names given to the three arms of human space, but virtually every nation on Earth is now represented throughout man's stellar community."

  "BookDescription": [
    "Humanity's exploration among the stars have brought it into contact with several alien species. All of these contacts have been peaceful, except for a shirt war against the Sung. Humanity had never met an alien species which presented a serious threat to its own species ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ until the Kafers.",
    "Humanity's contact with the Kafers is probably the most significant event in human history since the Twilight War of the late 20th century. The encounter, like that war, could conceivably spell the end of the human race.",
    "The Kafer Sourcebook contains al information necessary for the 2300 AD referee to create campaigns and adventures involving the Kafers. It describes the physiology and psychology of the Kafers, concentrating on their unique intelligence, and explains why there can never be peace until either humanity of the Kafer population is destroyed.",
    "Covering the origin and evolution of the Kafers, the Kafer Sourcebook goes into the details of the Kafer homeworld and explains Kafer motivations and drives, their history, their society and social structure and their technology.",
    "The Kafer Sourcebook details the political and governmental structure of the Kafer Associative, discusses the political motivations behind the current war and explains why it will get worse.",
    "The Kafer Sourcebook enables the 2300 AD referee to introduce new items of Kafer weaponry and equipment, as well as more complete details of previously described items. The equipment chapter is copiously illustrated (with some illustrations in full color). The players can be introduced to Kafer artifacts, which range from hand tolls and small arms up the Sigma-class starship. They can puzzle out the true function of the enigmatic \"worry stone\" often found in abandoned Kafer encampments or try to discover the technology, behind the recently discovered \"Kafer Computer Mark II,\" an advanced portable computer of chilling technological sophistication.",
    "A full-color map of the Kafer Sphere is included, extending tbeyond the boundaries of the original game map. The Kafer Sourcebook also presents a complete listing of the more than 30 new stars not included in the original game map as well as those already covered.",
    "Introduced in the Kafer Sourcebook is a new alien race, unknown to humanity so far but important to the understanding of certain aspect of Kafer technology and history.",
    "The Kafer Sourcebook also presents a treatise on Kafer language, including a pronunciation guide, a short vocabulary and samples of Kafer ideographs."

    "This is Earth. This is home. Even after years spent wandering among the colony worlds, where every turn brings anew discovery a man's heart quicken as he returns to the planet that gave him life.",
    "And Earth's cities hold surprises to rival those found on alien worlds.",
    "The Earth/ Cybertech Sourcebook describes the Earth of the 24th century from Earth's protective shell of warships that block the importation of dangerous alien organisms to the shining towers of Liberville spaceport; from the rain-slicked pavement of New York's alleys to the artificial landscape of Earth's computer matrix. The Earth/ Cybertech Sourcebook explains it all, with maps and diagrams that make it easy to understand.",
    "Earth/ Cybertech Sourcebook begins by explaining the major forces that shape the societies of Earth in 2300 AD. It examines all of the nations of Earth describing what life is like for their citizens from the daily work to entertainment to travel. The maps clearly show national boundaries, major cities, and major transportation networks, giving the referee valuable aid in running adventures on Earth. And the illustrations help bring 24th century Earth into focus for players.",
    "Earth/ Cybertech Sourcebook explains the cybertech revolution that is sweeping through Earth's cities. Statisitcs are given for surgical, chemical and mechanical enhancements of the body, with price, so that players can get in on the leading edge of this new technological wave. Equipment listed includes bionic eyes that allow you to snap pictures with a thought, \"smart guns\" whose sights are wired directly to character's brains and \"slashers\", carbon filament blades than can be extended at will from the fingertips.",
    "Rules cover the operation of cyberdecks, the computers that deck jockeys yse to project their minds directly into Earth's computer network. With these rules, a character can purchase a deck, tinker with its capabilities and buy software programs to back him up on his runs into cyberspace. Cyberspace itself is described as well, as are rules for conducting computer battles within, the cyberspace matrix.",
    "The Earth/ Cybertech Sourcebook includes a detailed cyberpunk adventure in which Provolution agents seek to unleash terror upon an unwitting New York City, and only the players can stop them. Floor plans are included for this adventure, as are sample characters, so that the 2300 AD can begin running it almost immediately.",
    "Whether your players are just desiring to visit Earth for a short time or you have group of cyberpunk fanatics on your hands, the Earth/ Cybertech Sourcebook will meet your needs, adding loads of valuable information to your 2300 AD campaign and lots of fun for your players."

    "Another distant explosion shook the complex, throwing Konrad to the corridor floor. The cement torw at his knees and the plams of his hands. Blinking back tears, he climbed to his feet. Through a nearby viewport he could see the huge Kafer battleship approaching, its bulk blotting out the stars.",
    "\"There's nowhere left to run.\" It amazed him how calml he could accept that. \"Sixteen years old, and I'm going to die.\" Suddenly, his surroundings took on a special clarity. He could hear the hum of the overheard lights, smell the smoke from far down the hall. He noticed the laser scars on the Kafer battleship where the defense systems had destroyed a gun tower. As he watched, a jack turret opened, and the inside began to glow red as its power built toward discharge. There was a sudden flash of light.\"",
    "The Past",
    "In 2295, humans and Kafers first met. Kafer ships discovered a human research facility orbiting Arcturus. The humans sent radio messages to the aliens but received no reply. Then, suddenly, without warning, the Kafers left the system.",
    "Station personnel reported the alien contact to Terran officials and, regretting the lost opportunity to establish relations, continued to study the star. Two years later, reports from the Arcturus system ceased.",
    "Early in 2298, Kafer ships swarmed into the Eta Bootis system and, driving away the human space fleet, bgean an attack on the Eta Bootian colony world, Aurore. The aliens destroyed the world's orbital facilities and landed ground troops on the planet.",
    "Human space forces reentered the system with reinforcement from nations cooperating in the attack, and by 2299, the alien fellt was driven back. Then the humans fell back to Eta Bootis where a defensive lione could be established. An uneasy silence settled on the Frontier. No one knew when the enemy might attack again.",
    "The Present",
    "It is now 2301. The human fleet at Eta Bootis has been waiting at the alert for two years. While its leader have bickered over protocol and jockeyed for command of the combined fleet, individual ship crews have grown lax in performing pracrice exercises and routine duties.",
    "But the Kafers have been busy. The remnants of the small force that originally attacked the humans have reported back to Kafer war leaders, and the combined might of all the Kafer nations has been assigned to invade human space. Theur goal is nothing short of the eradication of the human race.",
    "The Future",
    "The survivial of the human race is in jeopardy. Its fate lies not only in the hands of its armies and navies, but also in the hands of its civilian populations. In Invasion, player characters can experience the course of the Kafer assault on the French Arm, but they can also take an active part in the human defense efforts, no matter what career they have been trained in. The final fate of worlds may well depend upon their actions.",
    "Invasion decribes the course of the Kafer campaign, from the initial assault on Hochbaden to the final, climactic battle at Queen Alice's Star. Along the way it treats each colony world in an individual chapter, explaing the particular effects of the invasion on that world. Both space battles and ground battles are described, with role-playing adventures and even official Star Cruiser scenarios included. With the information in this book the referee can run an entire campaign based upon the Kafer invasion."

    "The chief tenet of the Astrnomischen-Rechen Institut is the pursuit of interstellar exploration for the betterment of humanity. A rich and coveted pocket of stars lies a mere 350 light-years away. The time has come to unlock its secrets.",
    "Resting comfortably in the constellation of Tauras in Earth's familiar night sky, the Pleiades have long been an object of awe, worship, and inspiration for different human cultures. To ancient civilizations which placed tremendous importance on the heavily bodies, the unique character of the Pleiades was as compelling as it was puzzling.",
    "To the modern men of the 24th century, however, the Pleiades are very nearly as great prize - a storehouse of young stars just waiting to be tapped for information. The Astrnomischen-Rechen Institut, a foundation pledged to extend the boundaries of human explration and human knowledge, recognizes this potential and has for years been in preparation for the long voyage to this fabled cache of stars.",
    "The vehicle for that mission has been carefully designed and purposefully crewed for the tenuous journey across uncharted stars. The ship is called Bayern.",
    "After Bayern's aborted launch attempt in 2297, the Astrnomischen-Rechen Institut completed repair and redesign on its vital stutterwarp drive system, and the ship was then ready to set off again for the haunting star group. Now as the 24th century dawns on the human race, Commander Leopold Schmidt and his international crew of 110 brave explorers make ready to bid farewell to their friends and families for a journey that will last almost half a decade.",
    "The module Bayern contains all of the background data needed to run an ongoing campaign of adventures based around the monumental voyage of this great craft. The important crewmembers are all detailed, as are the ship's systems, including the computers and the extra vehicular craft used on the Bayern during the mission.",
    "Also included in Bayern are two complete adventure scenarios, Death Throes and The Daughters of Atlas. Each scenario is designed to begin or supplement a continuing campaign covering the unique encounters and adventures that can be found along the long flight of the Bayern."

Enjoying good relations with the Civilized Eber nations and with Manchuria (which holds the reins of power on the Chinese arm), the enclave may someday divine the deep secrets of the Civilized Ebers.",
    "And the Araba are not hesitant to use their unfluence with Ebers and Machurians to make life to make life difficult for the recently arrived Texans, in a jealous effort to protect their hold on Kormoran.",
    "THE TEXANS",
    "The Texas enclave was established eight years after the UAR enclave. In that eight years, the Arabs had wormed their way into the councils of the Civilized Ebers. Therefore, while by Terran treaty the UAR could not prevent Texas from planning an outpost on Kormoran, it could ensure that the Texan enclave had little chance of surviving. The Arabs convinced the Civilized Ebers to cede a parcel from the Great Desert to the Texans, believing that if the harsh environment did not destroy them, the savage Nomadic Ebers tribes would.",
    "Now, with the dawning of the 24th century, Texas has signed a landmark agreement with the Civilized Eber nation of Black Sky to build an Eber steam train line through the Great Desert. With this gain, the Texans have become a real threat to the UAR enclave.",
    "THE MISSION",
    "In the wake of the historic agreemnt between Black Sky and the Texas enclave, the Nomadic Ebers of the Great Desert have assmembled for war. Attacks on New Austin's outlying areas are increasingly frequent and a Texas Ranger is missing.",
    "The player characters have been recruited to serve as auxilaries alongside the Rangers. Now the Rangers have been ordered out into the desert to determine what is precipitating the war. Having come to Komroan for a peaceful break from Kafer fighting the player characters find themselves cast into the think of a mounting conflict with hordes of aliend who can throw spears through plate armor.",
    "What was advertised as a relaxing stint of suty is quickly becoming a nightmare."
