      "Where Man Meets Magic & Machine",
      "The year is 2060. Magic is as real as the mean streets of the mega-sprawls. Corporations call the shots while nailing each other through covert operatives in cutthroat competition. Flesh and machines have merged -- the street samurai with his smartguns and impossibly fast reflexes, the decker who can plug his own brain into the worldwide computer network, the rigger who links his mind to his vehicle and takes hairpin turns at fantastic speeds. And you're a part of this wired world, where corporate skyscrapers glitter over the dark shadows they cast. You live in those shadows. You're a shadowrunner -- a street operative.",
      "You may be human or troll, dwarf or elf. You may throw fireballs, pull out your trusty Uzi or slice through computer security with a program as elegant and deadly as a stiletto. No matter what, you get the job done. You're a shadowrunner -- a professional. You don't just survive in the shadows -- you thrive there ... for now.",
      "Shadowrun, Third Edition is a complete rulebook for gamemasters and players. It contains all the rules needed to create characters and ongoing adventures set in the popular Shadowrun universe. Shadowrun, Third Edition updates, revises, expands and clarifies the rules from previous Shadowrun rulebooks. It is compatible with previous versions of Shadowrun and with previously published Shadowrun source material."

For at the heart of war-torn Aztlan lies Aztechnology, a potential mother lode of paydata and newtech, and an almost certain source of death. Listen carefully to the rumors and judge for yourself which are true or false—Aztlan guards its secrets well, and Aztechnology will kill to keep it that way.",

This book also describes many aspects of life in Tenochtitlán (formerly Mexico City), and provides new rules for Aztlaner magic and Aztechnology corporate personnel.",

Too much cyberware and you're a cyberzombie—more machine than man.",

Dominated by enormous, world-striding megacorporations strangling metahumanity in their clutches, by 2080 most of the planet has surrendered to these corporate overlords.",

      "Stand up, join them, and dare to risk it all!",
      "Shadowrun, Sixth World builds on Shadowrun’s amazingly successful legacy, becoming easier to learn and play while still providing role-playing depth. Welcome to the marquee event of the game’s 30th Anniversary year!",
      "The Sixth Edition Core Rulebook (Shadowrun: Sixth World) is a slimmed down, streamlined version of the dystopian urban fantasy world. The book is only 320 pages, and features new art."

They are shadowrunners, and they’re waiting for you to join their ranks. Be an elf shaman, an ork street samurai, a dwarf rigger, or any of thousands of other possibilities. Find your unique expertise and use it to take the wild chances that can keep you alive, that will give you that one last chance at freedom. So you can survive until the next one.",

Whether they're starting a new band, recording guerrilla trid dramas, or launching a pirate tridcast where someone tells the truth for once, they can grab audiences by the throat and get them to listen.",

No Future is the Shadowrun guide to Sixth World culture, including information on music acts, trid movies and series, media sources, and sports, with a look at some of the voices bubbling up from the underground and demanding attention. With detailed setting information and relevant rules, No Future adds new elements and depth to Sixth World role-playing.",
    "No Future is a cyberPUNK sourcebook that details the culture and everyday life of the Shadowrun setting and is useful for whatever version of Shadowrun you play!"

  "BookDescription": [
    "The blending of technology and human flesh began in the late 20th century. Interfacing the human mind with computers was just the first step. Implants that “jack up” reflexes and cybernetic replacements followed quickly. Then came the Awakening. A five-thousand-year lull in the flow of mystical energies subsided, and Magic returned to the world. Elves, Dwarfs, and Trolls assumed their true forms, throwing off their human guise.",
    "In the world of 2050, the megaplexes are monsters casting long shadows. As shadowrunners, that’s where you live, in the cracks between the giant corporate structures. When the megacorps want something done but they don’t want to dirty their hands, it’s a Shadowrun they need, and they come to you. Though your existence is not acknowledged by any governmental or corporate database, the demand for your services is high. You might be a Technomancer, sliding like a whisper through the databases of giant corporations, spiriting away the only thing of real value—information. Or perhaps you are a Street Samurai, an enforcer for hire whose combat skills and reflexes make you the ultimate urban predator. Or perhaps a Mage, one with an ancient gift, the ability to wield and shape the magical energies that now surround the Earth. And that’s exactly the kind of firepower you’ll need if you get hired to make a Shadowrun...",
