It takes all of the key, player-focussed rules from Cepheus Universal and packages them into a single, useable volume. The Player’s Book also adds NEW features to the character creation process, including a term-by-term random method, familiar to players of most other Cepheus rules-sets; there is a group-creation system, quick-play gear loadouts for each career type, as well as random character name lists. Using the resources within this book, you can create a character ready for play in ten minutes, or go detailed and create a more three-dimensional and believable character in half an hour. Create your character randomly or by design – the choice is yours. Included are Cepheus Universal’s task resolution and combat rules, to aid in player familiarisation.",

Add highly poisonous or aggressive plantlife and a sulfur-tainted atmosphere and you have a very unpleasant world.
