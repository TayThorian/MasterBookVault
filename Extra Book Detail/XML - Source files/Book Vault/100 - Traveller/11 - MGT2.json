After it has settled in, the young duke-to-be enlists the Travellers to hunt the elusive creature in its adopted habitat but it proves to be a wily prey with heretofore unknown abilities. The hunters become the hunted and are seemingly forced to fight off the entire animal kingdom of the preserve. They will end up in a pitched battle for their very survival.",

From that sea grows the Clench, a writhing mass of plant life that extends far into the desert, providing life-giving crops for the world’s six million people. Unfortunately, the Clench is dying and the only people who can help are a remote community of psionic exiles living in the deep desert. The people of Adan have come to terms with their presence, but a scientific team from an Imperial Research Station has come to the planet to find the psions and strip them of their psionic abilities using a controversial new technique.

Within these covers you will discover the culture and society of these races, as well as their physiology and their psychology.",
      "<b>Darrians</b>",
      "The Darrians are known to be a pacifistic race who value excellence in scientific and artistic endeavours. Many believe the Darrians an easy target, or that their outlook makes them inconsequential on the galactic stage. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Darrians are heirs to some of the most advanced technology available in Charted Space, and their advancement continues. For those who believe they can conquer this race of pacifistic scientists and artists, the Darrians have a feared weapon capable of causing a star to go supernova –the Star Trigger.",
      "<b>Geonee</b>",
      "The Geonee claim to be the decedents of the Ancients, and have the ruins and remnant technology to support this. When first contacted by the Vilani, they were thought to be a Major Race until it was discovered they had reverse engineered their jump drive, causing the retraction of their position and relegating them to become a Minor Race. The Geonee have struggled to have their achievements recognised by the greater interstellar community ever since.",
      "<b>Dolphins</b>",
      "Dolphins where gifted sophoncy by GenAssist, a genetic engineering corporation founded on Solomani principles. The project was a success, and Dolphins have become recognised as a Minor Race in their own right. Their communities are based on principles of total freedom and equality, but they owe a debt of honour to the humans who gave them reasoned thought.",
      "<b>Orca</b>",
      "The Orca are another race granted sophoncy by GenAssist, but this time grudgingly. The project to raise them suffered a serious setback which nearly ended the programme if not for the generosity of the people of Sufren.

      "Aliens of Charted Space: Volume Four explores four species within Charted Space – the nature-loving Suerrat, the pacifistic Za’tachk, the mercantile Gurvin, and the xenophobic Tezcat. Within these covers, you will discover the culture and society of these species as well as their physiology, psychology and societies.",
      "<b>Suerrat</b>",
      "The Suerrat are a human subspecies transplanted from Terra to Ilelish by the Ancients. They claim to be a Major Race, as they independently developed interstellar travel based on generation ships but as they had not developed jump technology, others do not accept their claim.",
      "<b>Za’tachk</b>",
      "One of the oldest species associated with the Hive Federation, the Za’tachk are a peaceful (some would say cowardly) species. Their natural tendency to structure and organisation have made them invaluable to the Hivers in running the vast bureaucratic machine required for their federation.",
      "<b>Gurvin</b>",
      "The Gurvin are a hexapodal species resembling Terran otters and minks. They were the first sophonts encountered by early Hiver explorers, and their language was adopted as the primary form of communication in the federation. Consummate traders and merchants, the Gurvin are the commercial backbone of the Hive Federation.",
      "<b>Tezcat</b>",
      "A cat-like semi-humanoid species, the Tezcat are violent and warlike, with a xenophobic hatred for any sophont that does not resemble themselves. Much of their history has been marred with war and bloodshed, but through the unification of the Shaper Church, they have established a pocket empire and proven to their neighbours that they are too dangerous to cross.",
      "This book also contains rules for creating Travellers from each species, along with High Guard and Central Supply Catalogue entries."

Native races have forged their own empires across these stars. In the Extents the daring can make their fortunes, gain fame or infamy, and influence the course of events for entire worlds or distant governments. Alien races, forgotten mysteries, bitter rivalries and great opportunities await under the light of inconstant, giant, and dead stars.",
      "Spinward Extents presents two complete sectors near the edge of Charted Space: The Beyond and the Vanguard Reaches. The Beyond is a borderland between Aslan expansion and human pocket empires, both ancient and new. At the end of Imperial courier routes, it is home to the alien Sred*Ni, isolated worlds, and mysterious entities. The Storm Knights hold the line in an uneasy truce with Aslan clans, but other dangers and many opportunities await.",
      "The Vanguard Reaches is the spinward edge of settled space, a sector of proxy states for the distant Third Imperium and Zhodani Consulate. The sector is home to the warlike-Eslyat and peaceful Murians, dying red giant stars and the Helix Nebula. Warfare, politics, piracy, and sparse starscapes challenge Travellers who live and work in this distant sector.",

Robots may be stationary objects equipped with a single arm or nothing more than a radio to control other machines. They may move across the ground, sea or sky, equipped with limbs, tools and weapons of all kinds.",

The Robot Handbook also includes rules for making nanorobots and microrobots, androids, clones, biological robots and brains for both vehicles and spacecraft. And what is a cybernetic limb but a robot part? The Robot Handbook covers everything from a cybernetic arm to a whole mechanical body with a live brain inside.",
      "The Robot Handbook comes complete with an immense catalogue filled with robots built using these rules, acting as a springboard for your own designs and allowing you to begin using robots right away to be tools, companions or opponents for your Travellers to encounter."

    "BookDescription": [
      "The Trailing Frontier... a region of contradictions. At once a safe province and the future site of Humaniti's death-struggle against the K’kree of the Two Thousand Worlds; a backwater and a frontier. Half of the region lies within the Third Imperium, the other half is home to minor states and independent worlds. Beyond lies the territory of the Lords of Thunder, militant herbivores who have vowed to exterminate all meat-eaters.",
      "The Imperium considers the Gateway sector to be of vast strategic importance, yet cannot spare the resources to tame it. Instead, a host of entrepreneurs and small-ship owners cross the border in search of fortune and perhaps glory. Far from the strictures of Imperial regulations, the Trailing Frontier is a place to play fast and loose - and to be ready to make a quick exit. It is a hunting-ground for pirates and mercenaries, a golden opportunity for merchants and adventurers, and a graveyard for the unwary!"

The Imperial Navy details this massive force, from the great fleets down to a band of new recruits.",

What is the underlying design philosophy of Imperial warships? How do major ships and their escorts interact? How would the Old Expanses fleet respond to renewed conflict with the Solomani Confederation?",

This outward urge has taken Solomani explorers right to the edge of the spiral arm… and beyond.",
      "The Lubbock and Xuanzang Enclaves are little havens of civilisation out in the big black. Just keeping these forward exploration bases supported is adventure enough for many, but beyond them lies the unknown; the mysterious Rammak, the civilisation to reach and investigate the curious region known as the Spinner, and of course the long voyage out to Point Cetus – the most distant installation yet built by the Solomani people.",
      "There are many challenges on the Rimward Frontier. Rival Aslan and Hiver exploration missions, strange alien races, and the mysterious Hordes advancing out of the Flous Nebula. The greatest danger may come from other humans, descended from Rule of Man and early Terran colony missions. Some are glad to greet their long-estranged kin; others are territorial and aggressive. Far from home, with no support likely for months or even years, the Travellers must face whatever comes their way. Who knows what wonders await just one jump plot away?"

Beset by enemies on all sides, the Empire is now collapsing rapidly and has lost one world after another. However, like a wounded and cornered predator, the Empire does not plan to go down without a fight. On worlds liberated by the Hierate, freed human slaves – the hisol’i – struggle to integrate into Aslan society. On the Empire’s remaining worlds, there are billions more waiting to be freed.",

Detailed descriptions of Empire mercenary units, slaving ships, enslaved freedom fighters, black marketeers, key Hierate clans, the vaunted Camoranian Starfighters, and more are provided to add depth and colour to any campaign.",

Wars will be fought, worlds will fall, and Travellers will directly influence, take part in, and decide the shape of things to come.

      "The Traveller Companion is a compilation of variant and alternate rules. Variant Traveller creation systems allow specific tailoring, whilst alternate combat rules introduce hit locations and wound severity. Rules for hunger, thirst, temperature, atmospheric and water pressure effects make the universe more realistic, not to mention more hazardous. Encounters with animals and vehicles are also covered, along with the consequences of lawbreaking on personal and starship-operations scales.",
      "The game universe is expanded with advice on using tools such as Travellermap and the Traveller Wiki, interpreting UWP data to flesh out a world, and additional spaceport types. The Companion also contains rules for starship operations in gas giant atmospheres, travelling slower than light and in jump space, and making space travel more hazardous with minefields, missile salvoes, and new starship weapons. Also included are rules for entirely different styles of play such as narrative task resolution and the mundane events resolution system.",
      "The Traveller Companion is a complete toolkit allowing referees to pick and choose enhancements to their own campaigns, giving greater depth and weight to their adventures."

      "A grand 20 year campaign into deep space, commanding the exploration cruiser Deepnight Revelation.",
      "The Deepnight Entity",
      "It was alive when the stars were young. It saw the birth of galaxies, and it will see the death of the universe. It is growth and destruction; menace and saviour. It retreated into a prison of its own making, and there it waits. An exploration ship found the clues, and was destroyed. A researcher touched its mind, and was driven insane. What is it? We must know.",
      "Deepnight Revelation",
      "Deepnight Revelation, a former navy cruiser. Outfitted for the most stupendous mission in human history; a one-ship expedition along the Great Rift to the edge of the Spiral Arm. Deepnight Revelation will explore the uncharted systems along its path; contact unknown species and weather unpredictable dangers. At last we will stand before the gates to the Entity’s prison and demand entry. We will confront the Deepnight Entity and seek answers.",
      "One Ship, Many Stories",
      "There is a place for any Traveller aboard Deepnight Revelation; scientists and explorers, pilots and engineers, diplomats and rogues. There are mysteries to be unravelled, enemies to battle, and situations that require… unconventional… talents. The Travellers can take on any role they please, from humble research assistants to the mission’s commanders. The decisions they make will shape the course of the expedition – and perhaps the history of entire species.",

      "In a backwater cluster of worlds deep within the Solomani Confederation, a covert society has stolen a cosmic secret. Using lost, perhaps forbidden, knowledge the Order of Prometheus will lead humanity into a new age with their custom-made creatures. Loyal warriors, indefatigable workers and resilient beasts of burden, their Golems are the answer to every manpower and labour-relations issue a user could ever imagine.",
      "Investigating a remote installation, the Travellers stumble on evidence that someone is tampering with nature a little too much. A laboratory accident has cost the lives of the researchers, but where are the others of their team? The investigation takes the Travellers from the harsh world of Wasat, with its unusual starport, to logging camps and country estates. They will experience adventures aboard an atomic train and an awkward lunch with the notorious agents of SolSec.",
      "Finally, the Travellers uncover the sinister motives of the Order of Prometheus, and face difficult choices in a city overrun by mindless killing machines. The wrong decision will permit an atrocity whose backlash might be felt right across Charted Space."

      "Skandersvik is a complete campaign for Sword Worlds Travellers. As crewmembers aboard the merchant cruiser Skander they will voyage through Darrian and Five Sisters subsectors, into District 268 and finally home again. There is money to be made and glory to be earned on such an expedition, but it is not without its hazards.",
      "Freikorps Skander: An uprising in the outback of Bularia has caused what amounts to a civil war, trapping some of the Travellers’ contacts in a combat zone. Although officially prohibited from getting involved, the crew of Skander includes experienced fighters willing to join the fight as a mercenary Freikorps.",
      "The Bowman Deception: Following rumours of a downed Sword Worlds ship on Nirton, the Travellers slip through an Imperial blockade to investigate the wreck. There, they find clues as to the fate of the legendary Admiral Denisov.",
      "The Lunion Shield: During a transit of the Imperial systems unofficially known as the Lunion Shield Worlds, the Travellers are lured into a trap by devious pirates. Skander is a rich prize, but she may be too tough for the pirates to deal with.",
      "Skandersvik provides a background to the mission, the ship and her crew, creating many opportunities for incidents, side trips and mishaps along the way. There is far more to this expedition than trading profits and a payday at the end. There are reputations to be made, hidden agendas to be uncovered and a tricky path to be threaded through the complex cross-border politics of the region."

    "BookDescription": [
      "This is Free Trader Beowulf, calling anyone … Mayday, Mayday. A box emblazoned with those words went on sale for the first time on July 22, 1977, at the Origins III Game Fair, heralding the advent of the Traveller roleplaying game from GDW. It wasn’t the first science-fiction roleplaying game, but through its innovative design and through the development of its evocative universe of Charted Space, it would become the longest running SFRPG in the industry.",
      "However, its path would not be simple. After Traveller reached its early apogee just four years in, it would face decades of increasing problems, raising many questions. Why did GDW decided to shatter their Imperium? What led them to seek outside help to produce the second edition of the game? Why did they abandon the Traveller game system with their next revision? How could such a popular publisher face bankruptcy just two decades on? Similarly, what happened to Imperium Games, QuikLink Interactive, and others who followed in GDW’s footsteps as the inheritors of the Traveller legacy? And finally, how did Mongoose Publishing reach into the past and bring Traveller back to its position as the industry’s best-loved SFRPG?",
      "This volume answers those questions and more. It tracks Traveller from its inspirations in the early ’70s, though its initial publication, and across seven distinct editions of its original 2d6 gaming system. It reveals the stories of Traveller’s three major publishers; GDW, Imperium Games, and Mongoose, as well many licensees. Most importantly, it tells how Traveller fell into increasing darkness before descending into a Long Night, and how it rose again as a phoenix.",
      "From the author of Designers & Dragons, which told the story of the entire roleplaying industry, comes the intimate history of a single roleplaying game, culled from hundreds of primary sources and interviews."

      "Travelling is about the journey, not the destination, and few things shape a voyage across Charted Space as much as a starship. However, a starship is more than a mere means of transportation; it is also a home and a companion. To captain a starship is to be the master of one’s destiny – for riches, glory, or an untimely end…",
      "There are many books that examine about how to build and fly custom starships, but few on what it is like to work and live on one. That is where the Starship Operator’s Manual comes in.",
      "The Starship Operator’s Manual covers all aspects of life aboard the starships of Charted Space. Learn the workings of manoeuvre and jump drives, find out how to operate advanced sensors, and discover exactly what your role on a starship entails.",
      "Includes a complete walkthrough of the Scout/Courier, Far Trader and Safari Ship."

      "Reaching the ship, the Travellers learn why they were hiding on Utoland and where they must go next. More importantly, they unravel what they have done. The Fifth Frontier War is unfolding around them, and there is a good chance that they had a hand in starting it…"

Taking contracts issued by guilds, corporations, law enforcement, criminal syndicates and others, there are few things more important than the reward. Rivalling far trader captains in the light years spent travelling, bounty hunters chase down their marks across Charted Space and bring them in, dead or alive.",
      "Bounty Hunter covers rules for Reputation, the system by which a bounty hunter’s pay, contracts and support are measured. Learn how to hunt down marks, apprehend them, and get rewarded for your work. Bounty Hunter also features dedicated equipment, vehicles, ships, bounty hunting agencies, contracts, safe houses, hideouts and adversaries for use in your Traveller campaigns."
