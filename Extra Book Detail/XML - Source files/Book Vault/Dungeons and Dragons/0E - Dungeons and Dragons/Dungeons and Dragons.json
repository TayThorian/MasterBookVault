      "Your adventures will be different than ever before. Lower level characters must keep busy surviving and learning; but when you find the challenges lacking, or treasure too easily found, you may start to wonder? \"Is there anything more?\"",
      "There certainly is! Games for higher level characters are often different? as new as when the characters first braved the unknown wilderness."

As a DM or as a player, you may use either or both sections; over a hundred characters await you!",

      "The Shady Dragon Inn also contains the D&D statistics for those special characters who are presented by figures in the D&D and AD&D toy line, and provides a tavern setting from which players may start adventures or gather party members."

      "Alphatia, the most ancient empire, land of arcane and obscure secrets. It has grown for centuries and its might now overshadows the cauldron of civilization. Some say the Alphatians come from elsewhere, but no one knows for sure.",
      "Beyond the scope of mortals broods an evil mastermind, still in darkness. Once a betrayed emperor of ancient Alphatia, now an entity of the Sphere of Entropy, he seeks revenge on the greatest empire and on the race of man. His plots brought a deathly fog on all of Norwold. Perhaps it will extend to the southern nations.",
      "The matter is grave, so much that lords of the spheres have now to show their might. For them, it is time for mortals to intervene. Man defends his cause for him to earn divine favor.",
      "A great armada has been raised and able commanders must be found. Prove your worth, and the eternal portals of the spheres may open for you."

    "BookDescription": [
      "It is early, and low over the mountains the sun set the sky ablaze. The little red creature yawns, stretches its small bat wings, and scratches its horny head. Suddenly, a gong echoes in the room below, making the creature jump. Almost falling, it grabs hold of the large statue on which it was sleeping.",
      "Down below, the students are preparing for their daily barrage of courses in geography, economics, history, royal lineages, and magical instruction (including new spell research and casting). It is rumored that each of the school's instructors is a member (or leader) of one of the Seven Secret Crafts—with strange new abilities.",
      "All who live or come to live in Glantri are searching for a secret: the Radiance, a mythical force covering the whole of the Principalities. Now your characters can join the adventure, with this Gazetteer. Here are complete maps of the Principalities, a street map of the capital, and all the information you'll need to interact with the citizens—people ruled by wizard-princes, not all of them satisfied with that situation."

Your characters want to take a break from precisely that kind of relief."
