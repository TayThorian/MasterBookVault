      "Tales from the Lone-lands contains six adventures for The One Ringâ„¢, the official tabletop roleplaying game based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. All set in the lone-lands of north-western Middle-earth around the year 1965 of the Third Age, the adventures can be played individually, or as part of a larger tale.",
      "Ancient evils wake as the Dark Lord stretches forth his hand. Over the course of these adventures, the heroes may thwart the spies and stratagems of the Enemy, explore long-lost wonders of the north, and travel far from hearth and home. Preserve the spark of hope, and one day these empty, wounded lands shall be healed! Fail, and all will be destroyed..."
