    "BookDescription": [
      "Skullport, the Port of Shadow, is perhaps the best kept secret in all the Sword Coast. A mile and a half beneath the orderly streets of Waterdeep squats the most wretched and lawless pit of thieves, buccaneers, slavers, and sellswords the Realms has to offer. Under a moldering tangle of catwalks threaded between the stalactites and stalagmites of the cavern city, illithids, drow, beholders, and other plot and trade with emissaries from the surface. Monsters prowl the dark recesses and alleyways, gangs of zombies shamble about performing menial labor; here, anything and everything can be bought and sold—lethal poisons, foul tomes of forbidden magic, and slaves.",
      "The only law is meted out by the enigmatic Skulls of Skullport, mysterious floating humanoid skulls whose capricious judgements and madness-induced destructiveness are the stuff of grisly travelers' tales. Gold rules the ever-present twilight, and only those with keen eyes and blades may keep it long.",
      "This 96-page book contains the following:",
      "maps and general information about the three layers and four wards of Skullport;",
      "descriptions of over 100 notable sites in the wards;",
      "a partial map of the dungeons of Skullport—where the Skulls throw the folk they let live; and",
      "descriptions of notable NPCs and power groups of Skullport.",
      "Although no other Forgotten Realms setting products are required to use Skullport, this accessory can be used to provide supplemental information for the Ruins of Undermountain campaign expansion. Dungeon Masters can also use Skullport as a basis for an Underdark city in their own campaigns."

Now, rumours have surfaced that it has been found, and there are sinister parties that will stop at nothing to claim it. But the path to finding the throne is long and twisted, leading from a small village in the remotest regions of Tethyr to the bottom of the ocean! Those who follow it had best be prepared for the strange and wondrous - as well as enemies on every side - for it is no journey for the faint of heart.",
      "The Wyrmskull Throne is a companion adventure for the Forgotten Realms accessory Sea of Fallen Stars. It can be played as a stand-alone adventure or with the material presented in that volume."

Regardless, the mages of Faerûn foll up their sleeves and craft spells and items that they hope will empower them to win the office of Magister. A few will succeed. More will wish they'd never taken up magic in the first place.",
