Yet as deadly as these creatures are, they are pale shadows compared to the grim power they worship. ",

All the parties involved wield their own dread powers and are forces to be reckoned with. It is recommended that at the start of the adventure no characters be of less than 8th level, with loth level the norm as the characters leave the surface world and journey into the sunless realms of the depths beneath the earth. Characters of less than 8th level will quickly find themselves overwhelmed by the creatures they must face, and it is recommended that those of much lower levels begin play with Temple Of Elemental Evil or Scourge of the Slave Lords, which provide the groundwork for this adventure. Just as characters of too low a level will have difficulty dealing with the encounters within, those of supremely high level (18 + at the start of the adventure) will undoubtedly find the challenges within unsatisfying, and surely one such as Lolth would not wish to let into her web any opponent she feels could give her a fair fight! Such characters are best left running their own baronies and kingdoms, provided what support they may for lesser adventurers. "

      "Dungeon Masters and players: prepare yourselves to enter a whole new world-the world of Oriental Adventures!",
      "The material in this book will enable you to play the AD&D game as you've never played it before. In the lands of Oriental Adventures, characters are not judged solely on their prowess with sword and spell. Oriental characters' social skills and personal honour are just as important as their combat abilities. When was the last time politeness and proper manners really mattered in your campaign? How can characters associate with nobility if they know nothing of courts or court etiquette? How many AD&D characters worry about how their actions reflect upon their families and comrades? These and many other intricacies of social interactions and responsibilities are brought to light in this volume. Don't get the idea that Oriental Adventures characters don't fight. Pages and pages of Oriental weapons and armour are described and illustrated here. From the favoured weapons of the ninja to thin pieces of cloth that actually stop arrows, the arms and defenses of the Orient are yours in the lands of Kara-Tur. Have a favourite monster from Japanese films? Find it under Gargantua in the Monsters section! Want to learn a martial arts style or create a new style? You can do it in the new worlds opened up to you in Oriental Adventures!"

      "To an adventurer, the most prized treasure of all is magic. Open this book and you will find a concise listing of every enchanted item ever invented for the D&D fantasy role playing game. Volume One runs from Abacus to Goblet. The listing includes an experience point value and a gold piece sale value for each item. At last, you'll know exactly what every bauble in any hoard is really worth. No need to keep guessing. The listing also identifies the product where the item is described and the page number where you can find it. A complete list of those products (current through December, 1992) is also provided.",
