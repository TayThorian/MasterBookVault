      "Over 100 creatures are presented, from the Prismatic Dragon and the Clockwork Horrors to the Shades from the Demiplane of Shadow. Creatures in this book have come from the FORGOTTEN REALMS, BIRTHRIGHT, DRAGONLANCE, RAVENLOFT, DARK SUN, RED STEEL, and GREY HAWK settings (and a few have just sprung from the fertile minds of their creators).",
      "This collection, which is fully indexed, features new monsters from the Far Realm, and includes many creatures suitable for nautical and undersea adventures."

      "Deep within the bowels of the Earth there lives a fell race, the drow, who conspire and plot to enslave and destroy the surface realms. The webs they spin are many, and the tendrils of their power can be felt from the Crystalmist Mountains to the Pomarj. Yet as deadly as these creatures are, they are pale shadows compared to the grim power they worship. ",
      "<b>The Queen of Spiders! </b>",
      "The story of the Queen of the Spiders is one of plots within plots, wheels within wheels. Each level of the conspiracy has its own masters (or mistresses) and hidden reasons for their actions. All the parties involved wield their own dread powers and are forces to be reckoned with. It is recommended that at the start of the adventure no characters be of less than 8th level, with loth level the norm as the characters leave the surface world and journey into the sunless realms of the depths beneath the earth. Characters of less than 8th level will quickly find themselves overwhelmed by the creatures they must face, and it is recommended that those of much lower levels begin play with Temple Of Elemental Evil or Scourge of the Slave Lords, which provide the groundwork for this adventure. Just as characters of too low a level will have difficulty dealing with the encounters within, those of supremely high level (18 + at the start of the adventure) will undoubtedly find the challenges within unsatisfying, and surely one such as Lolth would not wish to let into her web any opponent she feels could give her a fair fight! Such characters are best left running their own baronies and kingdoms, provided what support they may for lesser adventurers. "

      "The material in this book will enable you to play the AD&D game as you've never played it before. In the lands of Oriental Adventures, characters are not judged solely on their prowess with sword and spell. Oriental characters' social skills and personal honour are just as important as their combat abilities. When was the last time politeness and proper manners really mattered in your campaign? How can characters associate with nobility if they know nothing of courts or court etiquette? How many AD&D characters worry about how their actions reflect upon their families and comrades? These and many other intricacies of social interactions and responsibilities are brought to light in this volume. Don't get the idea that Oriental Adventures characters don't fight. Pages and pages of Oriental weapons and armour are described and illustrated here. From the favoured weapons of the ninja to thin pieces of cloth that actually stop arrows, the arms and defenses of the Orient are yours in the lands of Kara-Tur. Have a favourite monster from Japanese films? Find it under Gargantua in the Monsters section! Want to learn a martial arts style or create a new style? You can do it in the new worlds opened up to you in Oriental Adventures!"

But the forces of Islam would have none of this, and under the call of jihad they arose to meet the invaders.",

      "Against the Slave Lords is a collection of four classic Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure modules that form a series -- A1: Slave Pits of the Undercity, A2: Secret of the Slavers Stockade, A3: Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords, and A4: In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords -- complete with original black-and-white interior art.",
      "Added to the collection is an all-new fifth adventure -- A0: Danger at Darkshelf Quarry -- that you can use to kick off an AD&D campaign that pits a group of adventurers against the evil Slave Lords! Module A0, designed for levels 1-3, sets the stage for events that unfold throughout the remainder of the \"A\" series.",
      "A1: Slave Pits of the Undercity: It is time to put a stop to the marauders! For years the coastal towns have been burned and looted by the forces of evil. You and your fellow adventurers have been recruited to root out and destroy the source of these raids—as hundreds of good men and women have been taken by the slavers and have never been seen or heard from again!",
      "A2: Secret of the Slavers Stockade: The battle against the slavers continues! You and your fellow adventurers have defeated the slavers of Highport, but you have learned of the existence of another slaver stronghold, and you have decided to continue the attack. But beware! Only the most fearless of adventurers could challenge the slavers on their own ground, and live to tell of it!",
      "A3: Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords: Into the Drachengrab Mountains! Hot on the trail of the marauding slavers, you and your fellow adventurers plunge deep into hostile Hills. Spurred on by your past success, you now seek the heart of the slaver conspiracy. But hurry! You must move quickly before the slavers recover from your previous forays and attack!",
      "A4: In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords: Trapped in the dungeons of the Slave Lords! The hardy adventurers must find a way out, with only their wits and courage to help them. But can they do it before everything is destroyed by the dreaded Earth Dragon?",
      "The book can also be run using the new D&D Next (or fifth edition) play-test rules, by encorporating the bestiary pdf in the June 7th, 2013 D&D Next Play-test document available from the Wizards of the Coast Website."

Desperate, the Potentate of Angleburg has sent for help from daring adventurers willing to face the devil men of the deep.

      "A new age dawns.an age of terror!",
      "They are close. I can feel them even stronger, now. It won't be long before the Masters come again. I have waited for them, waited for their return. Once they extinguish the Light, the true Dawn can begin.",
      "The illithids once ruled a mighty empire that stretched across many worlds. These foul creatures enslaved or destroyed whole races in their quest for ultimate power - until a rebellion spread like fire on dry plains. The mind flayer empire toppled, and the multiverse was freed from eternal servitude.",
      "Now, a hundred suns burn toward extinction, their light stolen by the flayers to reinvent their past. If the PCs do not stop the new dawn, the Dawn of the Overmind, the illithids will rule once again! Following the clues left by their benefactor, the adventurers journey over a vast world of ancient ruins. Buried deeply within these ruins lies an artifact of ancient illithid manufacture. This item is all that stands between the illithids and their nefarious goal: complete and utter domination.",
      "Dawn of the Overmind is the third adventure in a trilogy (originating with A Darkness Gathering and continuing in Masters of Eternal Night ). It can be played alone or linked with the other two parts of the trilogy to form an epic-length adventure. The illithid trilogy supports The Illithiad, a MONSTROUS ARCANA supplement that contains invaluable information on every facet of illithid life, psychology, technology, and ability."

Each site's entry tells the Dungeon Master what the place looks like at first glance and offers a detailed floor plan of the interior, as well as a picture of the exterior. Readers will also find fascinating notes about the characters who live and work in each site, along with one or two ideas for personalizing the spot to suit any adventure.",

The torchlight flickers, threatening to succumb to the oppressive darkness. Creeping along one striated granite wall, Arikus the warrior moves cautiously toward the great cavern ahead, its sides and walls disappearing into the gloomy distance. Cocking his head to one side to listen, he holds his hand up for a moment, demanding unconditional quiet from from his companions. Then , his arm relaxing in relief, he waves everyone forward and moves into the open. Before him, scattered to the far walls of the enormous cavern, are piles upon piles of glittering treasure - coins from countless kingdoms, sparkling gems, exquisite jewelry, and items of wondrous power - enough for twenty kings' ransoms. Arikus laughs gleefully, thrusting both hands into the nearest cache of coins to let them runs through his fingers. At that moment, a monstrous shadow looms threateningly over him. Looking up, Arikus blanches and stumbles back in horror before the terrible visage of a Great Red Wyrm. The fearsome dragon opens its razor-filled maw and spews forth a gout of white-hot flame, engulfing the hapless warrior...",
