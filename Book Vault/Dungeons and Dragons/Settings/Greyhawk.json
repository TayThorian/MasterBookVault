      "Deep beneath the keep of Castle Greyhawk, a really nasty device is creating mutated, unpleasant monsters that are running wild throughout the castle and the twelve-level dungeon beneath. The call has gone out for heroic, fearless, and perhaps foolish adventures to out-hack, out-slash, and sometimes even out-think hordes of doughmen, headless mice, manic bee queens, really bad dead things, burgermen, crazed chefs, and movie moguls. If they survive these and much odder obstacles, the characters still have to find the nasty monster creator and put it out of business.",
      "Castle Greyhawk contains 13 detailed levels for adventuring and exploration. Each is a separate adventure written by different author and each has its own unique brand of baffling weirdness. Some levels involve solving puzzles and some require good old hacking and slashing. The adventure can be played separately or all together as a grand quest to free Castle Greyhawk from the evil, rotten hordes that are plaguing it. The common theme of this dungeon is that no joke is so old, no pun so bad, and no schtick so obvious that it can't be used to confuse and trip up PCs!"

His name invokes fear in the hears of the smallest children, the bravest warriors, and the wisest sages. Like a malicious cat, the lich toys with all who stumble into his maze, tormenting them with strange puzzles and obscure riddles, monsters and demons, weird traps and dangerous magics. All who enter the crypt of Lyzandred find themselves scarred with his rune, proof of their visit -- and their folly.",

      "The Doomgrinder, a mysterious stone windmill many leagues east of the City of Greyhawk, has for centuries been the source of rumors, frustration and fear. The rumors say that vast treasures are stored inside—all cursed. The frustration belongs to hundreds of adventures who over the years have attempted to enter the windmill and failed. The fear is felt by those who believe the world will end when the stone sails of the Doomgrinder turn again. In the City of Greyhawk, powerful spellcasters read bad omens for the future, and the Doomgrinder is part of them. Some see no future at all good or bad.",
      "In this Greyhawk adventure, a group of brave heroes may finally learn the truth about the Doomgrinder.",
      "Designed for characters of level 4 through 8 but adaptable to any level, the adventure can be played on its own or as the climax of the Lost Tombs adventure series. It also offers countless opportunities for spin-off adventures, potentially providing the foundation for entirely new campaign directions, and months of exciting game sessions."
