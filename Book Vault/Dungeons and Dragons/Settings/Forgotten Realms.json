    "BookDescription": [
      "Skullport, the Port of Shadow, is perhaps the best kept secret in all the Sword Coast. A mile and a half beneath the orderly streets of Waterdeep squats the most wretched and lawless pit of thieves, buccaneers, slavers, and sellswords the Realms has to offer. Under a moldering tangle of catwalks threaded between the stalactites and stalagmites of the cavern city, illithids, drow, beholders, and other plot and trade with emissaries from the surface. Monsters prowl the dark recesses and alleyways, gangs of zombies shamble about performing menial labor; here, anything and everything can be bought and sold—lethal poisons, foul tomes of forbidden magic, and slaves.",
      "The only law is meted out by the enigmatic Skulls of Skullport, mysterious floating humanoid skulls whose capricious judgements and madness-induced destructiveness are the stuff of grisly travelers' tales. Gold rules the ever-present twilight, and only those with keen eyes and blades may keep it long.",
      "This 96-page book contains the following:",
      "maps and general information about the three layers and four wards of Skullport;",
      "descriptions of over 100 notable sites in the wards;",
      "a partial map of the dungeons of Skullport—where the Skulls throw the folk they let live; and",
      "descriptions of notable NPCs and power groups of Skullport.",
      "Although no other Forgotten Realms setting products are required to use Skullport, this accessory can be used to provide supplemental information for the Ruins of Undermountain campaign expansion. Dungeon Masters can also use Skullport as a basis for an Underdark city in their own campaigns."

But the path to finding the throne is long and twisted, leading from a small village in the remotest regions of Tethyr to the bottom of the ocean! Those who follow it had best be prepared for the strange and wondrous - as well as enemies on every side - for it is no journey for the faint of heart.",

Come, take another look and discover new worlds above and beneath the sea. Once you enter the Sea of Fallen Stars, you may never want to go home again.",

It provides a focus for the use of the rules supplements Of Ships and the Sea and Sea Devils, but neither of these products is needed to use this book.

Discover a drow city construdted entirely of calcified spider silk, a nigh-immortal dwarven king trapped in stone form, and a storehouse of knowledge that rivals Candlekeep. Learn the particulars of the alliance between Manshoon and the beholders of the Anaurian Hive, the ambitions of the true master of Firedrake Bay, and an explanation of the enduring strength of the beholder cults along the Lake of Steam.",

      "And there is more to these marks than a drunken prank. As you try to find out the source and meaning of your new adornment, you are drawn further and further into danger and mystery. Will you become a pawn in somebody else's power game, or will you fight for your freedom and individuality? ",
      "Curse of the Azure Bonds is an adventure set in the Forgotten Realms game word for the AD&D 2nd Edition game. It is based on the best-selling novel, Azure Bonds, by Jeff Grubb and Kate Novak."
