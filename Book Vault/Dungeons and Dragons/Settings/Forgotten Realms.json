    "BookDescription": [
      "Skullport, the Port of Shadow, is perhaps the best kept secret in all the Sword Coast. A mile and a half beneath the orderly streets of Waterdeep squats the most wretched and lawless pit of thieves, buccaneers, slavers, and sellswords the Realms has to offer. Under a moldering tangle of catwalks threaded between the stalactites and stalagmites of the cavern city, illithids, drow, beholders, and other plot and trade with emissaries from the surface. Monsters prowl the dark recesses and alleyways, gangs of zombies shamble about performing menial labor; here, anything and everything can be bought and sold—lethal poisons, foul tomes of forbidden magic, and slaves.",
      "The only law is meted out by the enigmatic Skulls of Skullport, mysterious floating humanoid skulls whose capricious judgements and madness-induced destructiveness are the stuff of grisly travelers' tales. Gold rules the ever-present twilight, and only those with keen eyes and blades may keep it long.",
      "This 96-page book contains the following:",
      "maps and general information about the three layers and four wards of Skullport;",
      "descriptions of over 100 notable sites in the wards;",
      "a partial map of the dungeons of Skullport—where the Skulls throw the folk they let live; and",
      "descriptions of notable NPCs and power groups of Skullport.",
      "Although no other Forgotten Realms setting products are required to use Skullport, this accessory can be used to provide supplemental information for the Ruins of Undermountain campaign expansion. Dungeon Masters can also use Skullport as a basis for an Underdark city in their own campaigns."

But the path to finding the throne is long and twisted, leading from a small village in the remotest regions of Tethyr to the bottom of the ocean! Those who follow it had best be prepared for the strange and wondrous - as well as enemies on every side - for it is no journey for the faint of heart.",

      "The place has many names: the Underdark, Deepearth, the Realms Below, the Night Below, the Lightless Lands. This vast world beneath the surface is home to fabled races such as beholders, cloakers, drow, illithids, and ixzan. Menzoberranzan, the dreaded City of Spiders, is only one of the hidden cities of the Underdark.",
      "This 128-page book, compiled by the Underdark's most famous son, Drizzt Do'Urden, lays bare the bizarre societies that lurk in the Realms Below. It includes an overview of the major races of the Underdark, an Underdark survival guide, and details and maps of the more than a dozen cities. Discover a drow city construdted entirely of calcified spider silk, a nigh-immortal dwarven king trapped in stone form, and a storehouse of knowledge that rivals Candlekeep. Learn the particulars of the alliance between Manshoon and the beholders of the Anaurian Hive, the ambitions of the true master of Firedrake Bay, and an explanation of the enduring strength of the beholder cults along the Lake of Steam.",
