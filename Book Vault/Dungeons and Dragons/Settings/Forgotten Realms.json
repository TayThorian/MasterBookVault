      "Skullport, the Port of Shadow, is perhaps the best kept secret in all the Sword Coast. A mile and a half beneath the orderly streets of Waterdeep squats the most wretched and lawless pit of thieves, buccaneers, slavers, and sellswords the Realms has to offer. Under a moldering tangle of catwalks threaded between the stalactites and stalagmites of the cavern city, illithids, drow, beholders, and other plot and trade with emissaries from the surface. Monsters prowl the dark recesses and alleyways, gangs of zombies shamble about performing menial labor; here, anything and everything can be bought and sold—lethal poisons, foul tomes of forbidden magic, and slaves.",
      "The only law is meted out by the enigmatic Skulls of Skullport, mysterious floating humanoid skulls whose capricious judgements and madness-induced destructiveness are the stuff of grisly travelers' tales. Gold rules the ever-present twilight, and only those with keen eyes and blades may keep it long.",
      "This 96-page book contains the following:",
      "maps and general information about the three layers and four wards of Skullport;",
      "descriptions of over 100 notable sites in the wards;",
      "a partial map of the dungeons of Skullport—where the Skulls throw the folk they let live; and",
      "descriptions of notable NPCs and power groups of Skullport.",
      "Although no other Forgotten Realms setting products are required to use Skullport, this accessory can be used to provide supplemental information for the Ruins of Undermountain campaign expansion. Dungeon Masters can also use Skullport as a basis for an Underdark city in their own campaigns."

Now, rumours have surfaced that it has been found, and there are sinister parties that will stop at nothing to claim it. But the path to finding the throne is long and twisted, leading from a small village in the remotest regions of Tethyr to the bottom of the ocean! Those who follow it had best be prepared for the strange and wondrous - as well as enemies on every side - for it is no journey for the faint of heart.",
      "The Wyrmskull Throne is a companion adventure for the Forgotten Realms accessory Sea of Fallen Stars. It can be played as a stand-alone adventure or with the material presented in that volume."

Come, take another look and discover new worlds above and beneath the sea. Once you enter the Sea of Fallen Stars, you may never want to go home again.",

      "Sea of fallen Stars is the first fully developed underwater setting for AD&D campaign play. It provides a focus for the use of the rules supplements Of Ships and the Sea and Sea Devils, but neither of these products is needed to use this book. Contained in these pages is everything you need to adventure in this exciting world. Bring your game beneath the waves with rules and magic that make it easy and fun to do, or create sea elf, merman, triton, locathah, or shalarin PCs using the character-creation rules herein. Either way, get ready to explore Netherese ruins, sunken ships, and abyssal trenches in the Sea of Fallen Stars!"

No one is just a demihuman in the Realms—there are acrobats, barbarians, giant killers, manhunters, pestkillers, prospectors, and even tunnelrats, but they're all demihumans and they all walk the face of Faerûn.",

Special benefits and disadvantages for each kit enhance the roleplaying experience while allowing characters to reflect their social roots and racial heritages. This companion to Wizards and Rogues of the Realms and Warriors and Priests of the Realms completes the series of kit-based sourcebooks for the Forgotten Realms campaign."

Regardless, the mages of Faerûn foll up their sleeves and craft spells and items that they hope will empower them to win the office of Magister. A few will succeed. More will wish they'd never taken up magic in the first place.",

Discover a drow city construdted entirely of calcified spider silk, a nigh-immortal dwarven king trapped in stone form, and a storehouse of knowledge that rivals Candlekeep. Learn the particulars of the alliance between Manshoon and the beholders of the Anaurian Hive, the ambitions of the true master of Firedrake Bay, and an explanation of the enduring strength of the beholder cults along the Lake of Steam.",

Many a tale of derring-do has been recounted in novels like the Moonshae trilogy by Douglas Niles, The Crystal Shard by R. A. Salvatore, Azure Bonds by Kate Novak and Jeff Grubb, and Spellfire by Ed Greenwood (creator of the Forgotten Realms fantasy world).",
      "Until now, the characters from these Forgotten Realms novels have been unavailable to AD&D game players. But no longer.",
      "Hall of Heroes provides complete histories and AD&D game statistics for such beloved characters as Elminster, the greatest sage and magic user of the Realms, Tristan Kendrick and Robyn of the Moonshae isles, Wulfgar the Barbarian, Drizzt the dark elf, and Bruenor the dwarf, all from the northern reaches, plus Alias and Dragonbait, Shandril and Narm Tamaraith, and many more.",
      "But the Hall of Heroes is more that a listing of game statistics: It's also a sourcebook describing (among other things) artificial and magical lifeforms of the Realms, as well as the lives of the world's elves, dwarves, lizardmen, and exotic creatures.",
      "Whatever your interest in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, you'll find much to entertain and intrigue you in this volume."

      "Situated where the Fire River flows into the Sea of Fallen Stars, Ravens Bluff is a bustling port and trade center. Residents and frequent visitors to Ravens Bluff often boast that the city is the brightest spot on the Dragon Reach, but even the proudest citizen thinks twice about taking to the streets when the Veil, a thick, cold fog, rolls in.",
      "The veil turns the city's vigorous docks into a gloomy den where only the brave, the stubborn, or the foolish go abroad. When the veil drops, neophyte adventurers join the Nightwatch, a special police force that sees to it that the fearless citizens who prowl through the Veil restrict themselves to licit business. A successful tour in the Nightwatch means wealth and recognition (those who fail quietly join the uncounted dead).",
      "This module is specially designed to introduce novice characters to the rigors of adventuring."

      "In part one of the Randal Morn Trilogy, \"The Sword of the Dales,\" the legendary leader of Daggerdale, Randal Morn, was captured by unknown assailants as he sought to regain the great weapon for which that adventure was named. A stalwart band of enthusiastic heroes was recruited to ride to his aid, yet all they recovered was the Sword itself and a message: \"Seek me in Spiderhaunt Wood.\" In the second part of the trilogy, \"The Secret of Spiderhaunt,\" those same adventurers found Randal and freed him briefly, yet he was almost as quickly torn from their grasp by an agent of the evil Zhentarim, seeking to end the threat of Randal Morn's return to power.",
      "In this final episode, the heroes must follow the kidnapper's trail and rescue Randal Morn again before the Zhentarim finish interrogating him and the axe falls upon his neck. Armed with the Sword of the Dales and aided by a powerful spirit that lives within the weapon, the heroes must march into the heart of Zhent-occupied Dagger Falls, free Randal Morn, and save the city from utter destruction. The job is dangerous - perhaps more than the heroes can handle - yet those who would live in songs and legends cannot concern themselves with living to a ripe old age!",
      "This is the final part of a trilogy of modules that began with \"The Sword of the Dales\" and \"The Secret of Spiderhaunt.\""

      "These adventures can be used one at a time, inserted into an existing campaign as a change of pace, or they can be a basis for an entirely new campaign. Either way, Lords of Darkness will be sure to give AD&D game players plenty of chills and excitement."

This free-wheeling adventure begins with an intrigue-laden journey from Waterdeep to Shadowdale. The party is thrown into the company of one Marcus Wands (also known as \"Marco Volo\"), a bothersome but likeable little rogue. In his guise of Marco, he gains unintentional help from the party members, leading only to their own arrest. To remedy that predicament, the characters are strong-armed into carrying an important letter to Shadowdale, and taking along Marcus as their \"guide.\"",
      "Of course, things are nowhere near as simple as they seem.",
      "There's this little matter of the Dragonking's Eye, a powerful artifact from another plane. Naively, Marcus thought he could steal the thing and pin the theft on Volothamp Geddarm, the roguish author of many popular books about cities in the Realms. The notorious mage-assassin Felibarr Blacklance has been hired to hunt for the thief, and he is a man grimly determined to earn his fee.",
      "Then, there's the business about this letter that's on its way to Shadowdale. It is accompanied by a rare enchanted item that wizards and fortune hunters want to obtain at all costs.",
      "A series of adventures ensues that takes the adventurers from Waterdeep to the Way Inn, by which time they will doubtless suspect there is more to Marco Volo than meets the eye. Amid the brawls and mistaken identities, the wild rides and the glowering villains, the characters never have a chance to slow down or catch their collective breath. What results is a light-hearted, picaresque adventure in the manner ofDumas and Sabatini, and a good time is had by all!",

      "Marco Volo - Journey is the second volume of the Marco Volo trilogy, designed for four to eight player characters of 6th to 8th level. This free-wheeling adventure began in Waterdeep as the characters set out on an intrgiue-laden journey to Shadwodale. Accompanying them is Marcus Wands (also known as \"Marco Volo\"), a bothersome but likeable little rogue.",
      "After leaving the Way Inn, the party heads for the Chauntean Monastery near Berdusk, where they have been promised safe shelter. Arrinving at the monastery. all seems pastoral and pleasant...but of course, things are never quite that simple.",
      "After escaping from the monastery, the PCs run afoul of King Azoun's Purple Dragons on the lookout for the infamous thief, Marco Volo. Only the timely intervention of a band of wandering entertainers enables the party to continue on its way.",
      "While on the road with Heino's Woodland Troupe, the characters learn the joys of being in a traveling repertory company, performing for a different audience each night. In the course of the adventure, the PCs also learn more about Marcus and his secrets - some of his secrets, anyway. There's still the matter of the mysterious letter, and that powerful artifact from another plane, the Dragonking's Eye.",
      "The adventure ends with Shadowdale in sight not to be reached, however, without a final confrontation with the notorious mage-assassin Felibarr Blacklance.",
      "This volume of the Marco Volo trilogy offers DMs the opportunity to run unusual encounters, and it calls for considerable role playing from all. Player characters cannot easily rely on their swords and spells to get them out of the brawls and misunderstandings that arise. What results is a dramatic but picaresque enterprise as the adventure continues!"

    "BookDescription": [
      "Marco Volo - Arrival is the last volume of the Marco Volo trilogy, designed for four to eight player characters of 6th to 8th level. When the characters first set off on an intrigue-laden journey to Shadowdale, they did not suspect how much trouble they would get into. Joined by Marcus Wands (also known as Marco Volo), they found him just a bothersome but likeable little rogue. No one suspected he was on the run from the crazy wizard Sabbar. The troublesome Marcus had previously stolen from him a rare artifact called the Dragonking's Eye, and hid it in the Spiderhaunt Woods.",
      "Now the party approaches the Spiderhaunts, and Marcus insists on diverting the group to retrive the Eye. But strangethings have been happening there. There are rumors of an oddly constructed keep of bone (or is it crystal?): of a warlord out for conquest (or is it a lich?); of goblin tribes strangely clad, an extra-planar beings banding with the giant spiders of the aptly named Spiderhaunt Woods. Something evil has denned at the heart of the forest. It has a mind of its own...and it has plans for Faerun.",
      "The last volume of the Marco Volo trilogy gives a DM tools to run this free-wheeling, fast-paced adventure, and the secrets of the powers at work behind the scenes. The player characters must face - and deal with - the mad wizard Sabbar, the annoyed Volothamp Geddarm (who wants to have \"a little chat\" with Marcus!), and ultimately the Dragonking's Eye itself. Even the gods themselves step in to have their say. In a dramatic denouement, this epic adventure draws to a close, but the memory of what transpired will live on!"

There are only three: A rabbit isn't always a rabbit. A rabbit doesn't want to be rich. A rabbit doesn't always stay put. An explanation? You'll find it in the Explorer's Manual. Read on, thou hearty adventurer!"

A party of adventurers is dedicated to peeling back the mystery of the Golden Lady's fate.

The heroes must brave the dangers of the Abyss and rescue the lost goddess from the clutches of one of the most brilliant and dangerous of all Abyssal lords.",

For centuries has the evil secret society founded by the mad mage and Chosen of Mystra, Sammaster, labored secretly-well, no more!",
      "This 128-page book lays bare the secrets of Sammaster and the secret society he created over 400 years ago. Herein is written the story of Sammaster's life, his triumphs, and his ultimate fall from grace, along with the history of the Cult of the Dragon, beginning with its foundation based on an obscure line in a tome of ancient prophecy. Learn of the Cult's most powerful current cells, their leaders, the dragons and dracoliches that work with them (or for them), and their goals. Discover the many foes the Cult has earned in over four centuries of treachery and industrious malevolent dealings. Also included are the details of some of the spells and magical items of the Cult and its dragons and dracoliches, including the one item that no Cult member will ever admit the existence of, much less claim to possess.",
      "Read about the many magical variant and hybrid creatures that the Cult uses to exercise its will across the face of Faerun. And finally, decide the best way to incorporate the Cult into a Forgotten Realms campaign by browsing the numerous adventure hooks for just the right scenario to tempt and terrify players of any gaming style."

Sometimes the differences are obvious—anyone can distinguish a seafaring mage from a turban-crowned spellcaster, or a thief of Lantan from a burglar of Amn. But often, appearance gives no clue: even wizards and rogues of the Dalelands vary from Dale to Dale, though one may look the same as another. Faerûnians are fiercely proud of their heritage, and they carry their native traits with them wherever they go.",

Special benefits and disadvantages related to each particular home town or territory allow players to create unique kits that can be applied to mages, specialist wizards, and rogues, and they can even be layered over other kits. As a bonus, two new player character subclasses have been included: the intriguing spellsinger and the stealthy shadow walker."

      "Dragons of Faerûn features an in-depth look at the dragons of the Forgotten Realms. Dungeon Masters are given information on adventuring in the Year of Rogue Dragons, on specific dragons and dracoliches of Faerûn, and on how those beasts might interact with player characters. DMs are given information on organizations that PCs can belong to or work against, such as the evil Cult of the Dragon. Also included is information on how to run a campaign that features the Year of Rogue Dragons—the one time, every 1,000 years, when the dragons of Faerûn rampage across the continent.",
      "In addition, this book includes ready-to-play adventures; new traps and treasures to be found within dragons’ lairs; new dragon spells; and new monsters."
