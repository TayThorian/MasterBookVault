    "Amid the barren wastelands of Athas lie the scattered city-states, each in the grip of its own, tyrannical sorcerer-king. Protecting their own positions with dark magic, they demand absolute obedience. The restless mobs are placated with bread and circuses --the arenas overflow with spectators seeking release from their harsh lives.",
    "The land outside the cities belong to no one. Savage elves race across the deserts while insectoid Thri-Kreen satisfy their taste for blood. Dwarves labor at projects beyond the scope of men, and feral halflings lie in ambush.",
    "Athas is a land of deadly magic and powerful psionics that offers promise of glory or even of survival. Those who do not have the cunning to face life on Athas will surely perish - leaving nothing but bones bleached white under the blistering rays of the DARK SUN",
    "On the sands of Athas you'll face",
    "Three new PC races!",
    "Muls - half-dwarf, half-human; specially bred for combat!",
    "Thri-Kreen - the savage mantis-warriors of the Barrens!",
    "Half-giants - bred for tremendous size and strength",
    "Three new PC classes!",
    "Gladiators - heroes of the arenas, the ultimate warriors!",
    "Templars - Wicked priests who serve the sorcerer-kings!",
    "Defilers - wizards whose powers drain the life around them!",
    "More powerful PC's",
    "All Dark Sun game characters begin at 3rd level!",
    "Ability scores that can go as high as 24!",
    "All PC's have one or more psionic powers!",
    "The new character tree allows players to advance many characters at once!"

    "\"Tyr is free! Tyr is free!\"",
    "Such is the heady cry that echoes from the darkest warrens to the gleaming chambers of the Council in that ancient city. Now is your chance to savor life released from the oppressive gloom of the sorcerer-kings-but for how long?",
    "New forces threaten the newly-born independence of Tyr, as outside forces march upon the city. King Tithian is determined to resist, but there are others on the Council of Advisors less eager to risk their wealth and lives for the cause of independence. It falls upon you to help mobilize and lead the citizen-army of Tyr on the road to Urik.",
    "Designed for four to six characters of 4th to 7th level, Road to Urik is set in and around Tyr, the campaign base for your Dark Sun game. A stand-alone adventure, Road to Urik can also be played as the sequel to Freedom."
