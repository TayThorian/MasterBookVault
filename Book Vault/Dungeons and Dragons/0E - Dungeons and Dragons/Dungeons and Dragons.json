      "You can also use this set if you'd like to discover what it's like to own a medieval castle. You can rule a land, bring civilization to the wilderness, and cope with all the threats to your territory, while facing monsters and magic of all kinds.",
      "Your adventures will be different than ever before. Lower level characters must keep busy surviving and learning; but when you find the challenges lacking, or treasure too easily found, you may start to wonder? \"Is there anything more?\"",
      "There certainly is! Games for higher level characters are often different? as new as when the characters first braved the unknown wilderness."
