    "Tis said of that ancient brooding forest that even before the world grew accustomed to the light of day, that her stems were grown high and her eaves already dark and contemplative. If ever those ancient trees have pondered, however, then it was in silent expectancy, brooding on a bent that only they and perhaps a few others may know, for it has never been theirs to speak with vocal tongue. Mayhap they ponder simple things, or maybe they wonder on the many creatures which have come to crawl the earth since those days before days, for all manner of beasts and monsters have come from the outlands to slip into obscurity underneath the shadowy vale of the Darkenfold.",
    "Mortality of Green includes an area map of the Darkenfold forest, information on the villages of Ends Meet and Greenbriar, handouts for the players, and new monsters for the Referee. The module is designed for and easily accommodates into any campaign setting, including the Winter Dark Campaign Setting. It is especially good for a single nights play.",

    "Though the gods dwell beyond the confines of the world, they are drawn to it. Too often they see to force their will upon the realms of mortals. Channeling this divine will lies upon the shoulders of the cleric and paladin, the skald and druid. They turn to the gods through prayer, ritual, sacrifice, and devotion, all in hopes of bringing that power into and through themselves, to unleash it upon the world at large.",
    "Within Gods and Legends, there are hundreds of deities for both your characters and monsters; dwarves, elves, gnomes, orcs, gnolls, and more besides. Each deity comes complete with information you will need from when to sacrifice to what kinds of temples they prefer. It also includes short stats for the gods of the Celts, ancient Germans, Norse, Romans and Greeks, Egyptians, and the Slavic Gods.",
    "More than that, Gods and Legends comes with guidelines on how to run deities and the characters that worship them.",
    "What Lies Within Gods & Legends",
    "Gods & Legends consists of three main parts: The Anvil of the Gods (a how-to section), Humanoid Pantheons (from humans to dwarfs to orcs), and real-world mythologies.",
    "Anvil of the Gods",    
    "Pantheon of Beliefs: In the first part of Gods & Legends you find a host of guidelines and suggestions for running deities in your campaign. Beginning with Deities in a Role Playing Game we explore the role of deities at the table, both for divine-based characters and the mundane fighter and rogue. The section covers role playing the deities themselves, the how and why, struggles with the deities, and a short description of the powers they all possess.",    
    "Gifts and Boons, the Holy Gift: Here we explore the roles of various classes in the deity/character relation: clerics, paladins, and druids.",    
    "Gods and Avatars: The abilities of gods transcend most characters, but it is always possible to use the god’s avatar, whether your games are high level or low. Learn how to use them no matter what your campaign.",    
    "Healing and Holy Symbols: These sections delve into one of the major aspects of character play and how it relates to the gods.",    
    "Humanoid Pantheons",

    "Real World Mythologies",    
    "Here we step lightly into the real world and plug in the stat blocks for Celtic, Egyptian, Germanic, Norse, and Slavic deities. Each entry exists as a stat block of the necessary information, as these are covered in far greater detail in the Mythos books (see related products below)."
