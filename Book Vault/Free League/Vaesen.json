      "Welcome to the Mythic North – northern Europe of the nineteenth century, but not as we know it today. A land where the myths are real.

There, people know what lurks in the dark. They know to fear it.",

Vaesen presents a dark Gothic setting steeped in Nordic folklore and the old myths of Scandinavia. The game mechanics utilize an adapted version of the award-winning Year Zero Engine.",
