    "D100 Space (Book 1) is a solo adventure game in which you will steer a captain on a starship through a galaxy in search of fame and fortune. Your captain will complete dangerous operations, trade, mine and fight fierce space battles across many star systems. With each game your captain will gain wealth, recognition and become stronger and increasingly skilled in their pursuits. All you need to play D100 Space, is a pencil, eraser, a few dice and your imagination.",
    "Your journey begins when you create a captain and start performing the 4 training operations. Once they have been successfully completed your captain will be ready to face far greater challenges and can begin taking on operations across space in an endeavour to gain notoriety and wealth, rivalling that of royal houses and trade lords. Who knows, one day their greatest exploits might even become stories and songs performed at every space station throughout the galaxy.",
    "D100 Space has been designed with a similar game system as D100 Dungeon and uses many of the same mechanics. However, D100 Space is a lot more that a simple reskin of the popular dungeon delving game. It has a galaxy to fly a starship across, with ports to trade with and find missions. There are asteroids, gas formations, dead planets, moons and worlds to interact with.",
    "D100 Space has two core phases. The \"Before Your Next Quest\" phase from D100 Dungeon no longer exists, but is instead replaced by a galaxy of star systems to explore; and interact with. Whilst the traditional quest phase of D100 Dungeon has been replaced by away missions; where your captain will go it alone on a complex, facility or enemy starship and fight or explore their way to complete specific goals."
