      "<b>The perfect starting point for discovering the Ninth World!</b>",
      "Nestled in the thick forest of the Glimmering Valley, a few dozen buildings surround an ancient structure and a pair of crystal monoliths. This village of Neandran enjoys a peaceful, agrarian life. The bold or restless might occasionally head into the woods to find the Dreaming Cubes, see the River Ring, or maybe visit the Old Witch in the Infinite Abode—but the distant city of Ketterach, and the wide world beyond it, are little more than rumors carried in by the occasional visitor.",
      "The Ninth World is vast, strange, and intimidating. But big adventures sometimes start small. Launch your Numenera campaign in this vibrant and relatable homeplace, filled with detail and life. Establish relationships and backstory, and ground your game in an immersive world. Then venture out into the Glimmering Valley, and begin to discover the wonders, treasures—and dangers—of the Ninth World. Follow the path of adventure, or explore the region sandbox-style. As your characters grow in capability, players and GM alike are introduced to what makes the Ninth World so unique and compelling.",
      "And when you’re ready, head out of the Glimmering Valley, prepared (as players, GM, and characters) to face the vast, awe-inspiring world of Numenera!",
      "<b>In The Glimmering Valley you'll find:</b>",
      "A richly detailed locale to launch a new campaign, filled with interesting and dynamic NPCs, situations, and locations.",
      "A chapter designed specifically for the players, to immerse them in this vibrant setting and help them create characters truly at home in the Ninth World.",
      "Loads of adventure to get your campaign off to an exciting start. Follow the plot threads or explore the vast sandbox of the Glimmering Valley.",
      "An easy on-ramp into the broader Ninth World, that helps players and GMs discover what makes Numenera such a compelling setting. Fantastic for players who are experiencing Numenera for the first time.",
      "Loads of new creatures, cyphers, artifacts, and more!"

Tales of great wonders and even greater dangers are not cautionary to you—they’re lures, drawing you ever outward to discovery and adventure. The secrets of the prior worlds beckon. But the vast distances, and the dangers they hold, are a daunting barrier. Until now!",

      "The Safe Wayfarer Travel Guide, full of useful in-world advice from seasoned Ninth World travelers.",
      "Plus two full adventures that can be integrated into the PCs’ travels or used at their destinations."

     " Two complete adventures. “Waking the Mega” introduces augmechs, as the PCs discover, revive, and ultimately pilot one against a titanic threat. “The Sun Doth Move” is a lengthy adventure with world-shattering consequences that can make an excellent capstone to your explorations of the Engine of the Gods—or to an entire Numenera campaign!"

      "Most Ninth Worlders know the datasphere only as the source of mysterious glimmers—those odd, unbidden flashes of knowledge and insight that, rarely, embed themselves within the mind. Some who study the numenera call it a network built by the ancients to surround the world with their knowledge. Some Aeon Priests say it is in fact many such networks that sometimes, but not always, intersect.",
      "And then there are those who have explored it. They tell stories of a vast metaspace that one can actually enter, to emerge in wholly other places—and along the way discover treasures and dangers unique to a bizarre realm unconstrained by the laws of nature.",
      "Some of these sages and adventurers believe its exploration offers the greatest key to unlocking the secrets of the prior worlds. Are they right? Only one thing is certain: the datasphere offers amazing knowledge to be learned, rich treasures to be discovered, and all-new challenges to be overcome.",
      "Voices of the Datasphere contains:",
      "An entirely new mode of play, in which characters translate into the virtual metaspace of the datasphere and become avatars of themselves in a bizarre and timeless realm. Explore the datasphere itself, or use it to travel vast distances across the Ninth World.",

      "Numerous secrets of the prior worlds, such as the likely purpose of the Clock of Kala, long locked away within the knowledge vaults of the datasphere.",

For the first time in memory, though, the Shadewalker has done something different. Is the giant machine leading the town into danger? Or becoming a threat itself? It’s up to the player characters to find out!",

And it’s a great introduction to Cypher Play Season 18-1 (January through April 2018)—which itself is a lead-in to the launch of Numenera Discovery and Numenera Destiny."

      "The isolated aldeia of Tavrul is suffering a strange plague: duplicates of its citizens have started wandering into town. They seem to be identical to their originals in personality, memories, and ideals, but their presence is unnerving and confusing at the very least. Duplicates of the living were troubling enough, but now the dead have appeared—and their motives seem much more sinister. Can the PCs discover the cause—and what happens when their own duplicates begin to appear?",
      "This 16-page adventure was run in official 2022 Numenera events at Gen Con and Gamehole Con, and was specifically designed to create interesting outcomes that play out differently each time the adventure is run. It’s great as a stand-alone scenario for new or experienced Numenera players, or is easily integrated into an ongoing campaign. Six pre-generated characters are included, so you have everything you need to play!"
