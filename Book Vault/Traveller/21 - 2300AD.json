    "BookDescription": [
      "Three hundred years from now, humanity is claiming worlds far from Earth. Despite nearly destroying itself in the Twilight War, despite all the wars since, humanity has held on and kept its dream alive. 2300AD is the story of that dream, as humanity reaches for the stars.",
      "This is a richly-developed hard science fiction universe, with ships spinning against the night as they are propelled by the stutterwarp drive, a true violation of physics as we know now it. Airships, helicopters and hovercraft are common sights on worlds of the frontier, while spaceplanes and rockets carry explorers and traders to orbit, and from there starships take them across the gulf of space to the colonies.",
      "Campaigns in 2300AD range from interstellar exploration and war on the far frontier, building new colonies on hostile worlds, discovering and understanding alien species, and engaging in espionage and crime in the gritty mega-cities of the Core worlds.",
      "The 2300AD box set contains:",
      "Book 1 Characters & Equipment: Everything you need to create explorers, company agents, military personnel, merchants and other inhabitants of 2300AD. This book also contains a comprehensive equipment guide, personal augmentations, and a selection of robots and drones commonly used in space and on colony worlds.",
      "Book 2 The Worlds of 2300AD: An exploration of the universe of 2300AD, from the Core worlds to the furthest colonies. You will learn about the aliens and animals that inhabit them, how humanity has adapted to living on their surfaces, and the most hostile of environmental threats to be found beyond the Earth.",
      "Book 3 Vehicles & Spacecraft: A full guide to operating and fighting in spacecraft and vehicles, from humble dirt bikes to powerful spacegoing frigates. There is also a glimpse at the alien spacecraft that have been encountered thus far by humanity.",
      "Starchart of Known Space: A massive poster map depicting every star system known to humanity and the routes starships take to each."

  "BookDescription": [
    "Aerospace engineering is the art and science of designing spacecraft and starships. This practice encompasses a range of craft from sleek surface-to-orbit craft to lumbering bulk carriers, and the aerospace engineer is key to their design.",
    "Spacecraft and starships are the lifeblood of exploration and commerce. They are also vital in the defence and acquisition of colony worlds and the economies that rely on them. The stutterwarp drive provides the key to interstellar travel. Rather than taking decades or even centuries to reach the stars, stutterwarp reduces that time to days. The most difficult part remains escaping a planetary gravity well; once in orbit, you are halfway to anywhere.",
    "The Aerospace Engineers’ Handbook provides everything you need to design not just the ships of human space, but also the vessels of the alien Kaefers, Pentapods, and Sung. It also covers the design of drones, space stations, and alternative means of achieving orbit.",
    "Alongside this, there is further information on those living in space, the outsiders who abandoned planets for the stars, along with the major space powers and their fleets. The Aerospace Engineers’ Handbook also contains a selection of drones and ships, for Travellers to command, fight, or run away from, with advanced rules for spacecraft combat."

    "In order to connect all those worlds with the systems of the Core, starships are required. Interface craft are required to connect the great ships with the worlds below, other ships are need to find raw materials, and to find new worlds. And still other are required to protect all those other ships and the worlds they serve.",
    "This book contains many drones, fighters, freighters, landers and warships from across human space, along with a selection of ships used by the three space-faring alien species at the edge of human space: the Pteranodon-like Sung; the odd little biotech masters, the Pentapods; and the hulking, vaguely-insectoid Kaefers, unrelentingly-hostile and bent on conquest.",
    "The 81 ships, drones, modules and stations in this volume build on the ships presented in 2300AD, and add new opportunities for trade, diplomacy, exploration, and combat."

And nations fight each other for political power to determine who will lead the human race in the struggle to tame the universe. You can be part of this new gae in 2300 AD - the state-of-the-art in science-fiction role playing.",
    "2300 AD plays against a background of Earth and its colonies 300 years after the cataclysm of the World War III, The Twilight War. Set in a world where nations still clash, civilization has crawled back to its pre-war levels, and then beyond. The world is dominated by the Third French Empire, which maintains a shaky peace among its jealous rivals.. Earth's hundred nations have colonies among the stars. First contact happened long ago, and commerce with aliens in now commonplace.",
    "Civilization has flowered to a point undreamed of earlier, but worms are at the blossoms core. One alien race, the Kafers, is bent on eradicating humanity. Anarchists labor to bring Earth's rule crashing down. Smugglers transport alien products to other worlds, thoughtless of ecological effects. Pirates prey on merchant and colonization vessels.",

    "Playable realism. Many games which are realistic cannot be played; most playable systems aren't terribly realistic. 2300 AD is both at once, balancing detail with simple, accurate game systems.",
    "The heart of 2300 AD is its task resolution system. Rules covers all aspects of conflict resolution, from creating new scientific equipment to flying starships to running group combat. Clean but detailed rules also cover player character generation and experience, starship operations and combat, star system and world generation, and non-player character skills and motivations (including six different alien races), making 2300 AD the state-of-the-art in science-fiction role playing.",
