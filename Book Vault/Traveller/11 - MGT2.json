      "The raiders of Oghma mercilessly prey upon the blighted star systems of the Outrim Void. Their endless plundering has reduced their neighbours to pre-starflight technology. When the Travellers get caught up in an Oghman raid, they find themselves going to the raiders’ homeworld, a strange and unique place where starfaring technology meets barbarism.",
      "But something is happening on Oghma. Oghma has deep, dark secrets and the Travellers can either help drag this savage world out of darkness, or be swallowed up by it forever."

      "Join Bu and Embla, Travellers of Charted Space, as they visit the world of Vrirhlanz in the Vargr Extents, to take a break with Embla’s family. The homeworld of the Hlanssai, who have made their way throughout Charted Space on ships of the Vargr, Vrirhlanz is as chaotic as the Hlanssai themselves. On a world technically ruled by Vargr, learn how the Hlanssai keep themselves free of outside control and hear Embla’s reflections on her home from the perspective of one who has travelled across entire sectors."
