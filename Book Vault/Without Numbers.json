      "The world is neon and dust.",
      "There is nothing more than the flesh. There is nothing greater than the wires. There is nothing to dream that is not sold and nothing to worship that is not made. It is a mirrorshade world of human reflections, every red hunger and every black passion worshiped in cathedrals of glass and greed. The great love their sins like children and the least want only to be great. Who could hope for more?",
      "Cities Without Number is a cyberpunk role-playing game built for sandbox adventures in a dystopia of polished chrome and bitter misery.

Whether polished metal or flesh and blood, your operators will risk their lives and more to seize those precious things a merciless world would keep from them.",

      "Fifty Mission Tags for adventure creation, plus guidelines and step-by-step procedures for handling facility infiltrations, managing local heat, selling loot, and other activities beloved of corp-hating street scum everywhere",
      "The default campaign setting of the City, a premade backdrop to help you get into the game as quickly as possible",
      "And that's just in the free version of the game. In this deluxe edition, you'll also be getting...",

      "The stars gutter and the skies fade and the earth grows weary with years. Ages of men and of Outsiders have ascended and been forgotten, and only the bones of their cities and the dust of their dreams remain upon this tired world. The Legacy of their laws is woven deep now, the edicts of dead gods and fallen sorcerer-kings made to trace patterns of power we no longer understand. We are heirs to their unseen empires, and our lives are built upon their ashes.",
      "Worlds Without Number is a fantasy role-playing game, one fully compatible with the hit sci-fi game [Stars Without Number]. It's built from the ground up to provide gritty, hard-edged adventure in the fathomless future of the Latter Earth, a fantastic realm of time-lost sorcery, savage foes, and barbaric splendour. The cold steel in the fists of your heroes and the half-understood sorcery in their tomes must suffice to overcome the monstrous remnants of ancient alien rulers and the present depredations of ruthless lords and hideous beasts alike. The riches of lost ages await in the subterranean Deeps that once held their kingdoms, and even the heavens above are not beyond the reach of the recklessly daring.",

It's packed solid with system-neutral GM tools and worldbuilding support, with hundreds of pages of useful tools, tags, tables, and practical advice usable by any GM, regardless of their favourite setting or system. The well-loved sci-fi tools of Stars Without Number are reworked here to support fantasy gaming, whether in the provided setting of the Latter Earth or in your own carefully-crafted homebrew world. Even GMs who don't prefer the OSR-compatible game system of WWN will find more than half the book dedicated to tools they can use in the systems they like best.",

      "Worldbuilding tools crafted to the renowned Sine Nomine standard. Did you like the hundred different world tags in SWN? Then have two hundred inspirational tags to help you build ruins, courts, communities, and wilderness points of interest. Grab a wealth of tools for building histories, societies, governments, religions, and geography, all written with a keen eye toward producing good, playable content for your adventuring group.",

      "Bonus character classes, including the Adunic Invoker, Darian Skinshifter, Llaigisan Beastmaster, Sarulite Blood Priest, Kistian Duelist, and Vothite Thought Noble. Each one is built to help support a broad character concept, such as shapeshifting, mind control, animal companions, divine blessings, or swashbuckling fighters- concepts you can import to any setting.",

This is Montfroid, a cold shore on the coast of Couront, and the weak and foolish linger only in sad tales.",
      "The Diocesi of Montfroid is a gazetteer set in the Latter Earth of the Worlds Without Number fantasy role-playing game. An isolated frontier province of a hard-pressed kingdom, Montfroid is a wild land of isolated villages and fearsome foes, with the ruins of two prior ages of settlement scattered amid forbidding pine forests and craggy hills. Its folk cling to their faith and the chansons of their heroic past, trusting in both to drive back their countless foes.",
      "Within the pages of this gazetteer, you'll find...",
      "A complete campaign setting for novice adventurers, with challenges and situations suitable for a band of 1st to 3rd level heroes.",
      "Full details of a half-dozen villages and the chief town of Castelnou, each with NPCs and problems for budding adventurers to encounter.",
      "GM helps such as a Montfroid bestiary, local name tables, premade retainers, and tips on dealing with crime, taxes, and other matters of interest to adventurers.",
      "Milon's End, a fully-developed four-level beginner dungeon with GM tips on handling the actual running of the adventure.",
      "While the Diocesi of Montfroid is set in the kingdom of Couront mentioned in the Atlas of the Latter Earth, it's been built to fit neatly into any conveniently remote chunk of coastline in your own fantasy world. In the same vein, Milon's End has been fashioned to suit any location where an abandoned manor might be found.",
      "So sally forth into the wilds, benevolent reader. Whether playing Worlds Without Number or another old-school inspired game, the Diocesi of Montfroid gives you everything you need to start a fresh campaign of youthful heroism, glorious deeds, and potentially tragic endings."
