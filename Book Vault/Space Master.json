      "The cat pounced again, and Christian swung his sword. The monoblade clashed with the cat's hazzok, throwing Christian to one side and bruising his shoulder as 250kg barreled through where he used to be standing. Christian scrambled back to his feet, just in time. He didn't know why the cat was after him, but when a Falar wanted you dead, you usually died. He swung again as the cat charged. This time several supports cracked and the scaffolding slid to a bit of an angle. Not good. The cat was crazy. What was he thinking? It didn't matter. Christian didn't need to think like a cat. He needed to think like a monkey. What could a monkey do that a cat couldn't?",
      "This Equipment Manual provides everything an enterprising privateer can carry - and more! Picture yourself in kinetic armor with a needler in one hand, a monosword in the other hand, and a sniping plasma-carbine with holo-sights on your back. How about adding on a thruster pack, a medscanner, a sneak suit, and a velocity shield? Going camping? Try anti-glare lenses, a vapor canteen, and an environment tent. With the right connections, you might even be able to load up with professional and military grade gear. Also included are 5 critical tables, 16 attack tables, complete tech level benchmarks, and guidelines for construction & design, malfunction & repair, and breakage. Outfit yourself for adventure! Dress for the kill! Equip to the max!",

      "After several, agonizing seconds, he managed to slide a new power cell into his blaster. The burns along the left side of his body made the slightest movement agony. His muscles twitched spasmodically, as nerves died. His burned flesh twitched as it cracked and flaked away.",
      "This was bad. He took a deep breath and checked his blaster's setting. there was no room left for tactics. He could make a final charge on continuous fire. If he was really lucky, he might live long enough to kill one of his foes. Maybe two. It was either that or wait for his life to ooze out half a dozen small laser wounds.",
      "Screaming with more bravado than he felt, he swung around the corner, firing wildly. beams of coherent light began seeking him out as he charged headlong, his blaster pulsing in his hand.",
      "Revel in MORE POWER! Blaster Law is the complete guide to energy weapons and their use in combat. Spacemaster: Privateers has a ton of combat and power, but Blaster Law takes this to the max, expanding directed energy weapons. It uses a tech level system and gives complete weapon creation rules, for use with anything from primitive spacefaring worlds to power weapons invented by worlds on the cutting edge."

      "The Space Master System is useable in a variety of SF environments, from a black near future of post-holocaust Earth, to a culture of high-tech exploration, to a distant time where civilization has fallen to superstitious ruin.",
      "Choose from 17 professions, including Armsman, Planetologists, Telepaths, Starship Pilots, or Engineering Specialists. There are dozens of sub-professions, yet all are flexible, eliminating artificial restrictions. Over 120 skills and a rich selection of background options allow each character to be a complex, multi-talented individual. The sophisticated rules are set out in a lucid, understandable format.",
      "Space Master: The Role Playing GameTM is completely compatible with all Space Master Modules, and is the first part of a Science Fiction Gaming Trilogy. Space Master: Star Strike TM (Fall 1988), a fast-paced game of interplanetary ship combat, puts you in the gunner’s chair as you face enemy starships. Space Master: Armored AssaultTM (Winter 1988-89), moves the combat planetside, where Hovertanks, Powered Armor, and Aircraft vie for supremacy. Space Master can also be integrated with Rolemaster; used together they set the stage for sweeping, coherent, science-fantasy campaigns."
