      "From the fringes, the unknown beckons. Pathfinder Dark Archive contains secrets that any player or GM can use to reveal the paranormal lurking in their Pathfinder games! This spine-tinglingly secretive 224-page hardcover rulebook presents two new character classes perfect for delving into the unexplained: Unleash the untold power of your mind as the psychic or leverage supernatural secrets and mystic implements as the thaumaturge!",
      "Beyond these new classes, eight secret case files each provide player options, GM tools, and lore into a different paranormal topic, including:",
      "Strange cryptids glimpsed in the night, gear to track them, and the powers you might gain by surviving an encounter with one",
      "Cults and esoteric belief, with apocryphal divine magic and the secret of becoming a living vessel for an eldritch being",
      "Temporal anomalies, with archetypes that skim along the surface of time and a new mystery for oracles unbound from causality",
      "Each file concludes with a short adventure to immerse players in the paranormal, spanning across Golarion—play all eight to uncover the inexplicable phenomena of the Age of Lost Omens!"

Lost Omens Firebrands takes a detailed look at the characters that choose to take on oppressors or simply head out on adventures for fame and fortune. This book presents information on the Firebrands organization, from membership, to spreading the word of rebellion, to the missions to defeat tyranny, and the types of daredevil antics they perform for fun. The book also features new rules content including new equipment, magic items, spells, and support for archetypes for players who want to play a Firebrand in their campaigns!"

      "When the first dwarves reached the surface of Golarion, they built enormous keeps as a monument to their legacy and to serve as their new home. The mightiest of these keeps was Highhelm, a Sky Citadel deep in the Five Kings Mountains. While other Sky Citadels have fallen since the Quest for Sky, Highhelm holds strong, serving as one of the major centers of dwarven culture.",
      "Lost Omens Highhelm delves deep into the Emperor's Peak to present Highhelm in all its glory. This book details everyday life in the city, dwarven culture, and the various clans that influence the Sky Citadel. It also provides a full gazetteer of the city's layers and surroundings, each with adventuring locations and sites of intrigue suitable for a multitude of adventures. An included poster map presents Highhelm's layers in high detail and serves as an aid for campaigns centered on the dwarven city. Characters looking for new options can visit Highhelm for new equipment, ancestry feats, animal companions, and more!"

Prophecy is dead and history hangs on a feather; even the slightest breath might change the course of peoples and nations. Strike out and seize your destiny in an uncertain future!",
      "This massive 304-page gazetteer features a look at the history, cultures, and peoples of Tian Xia, with summaries of over 20 distinct nations and kingdoms on, above, and under the continent. It’s accompanied by a giant poster map displaying this region of the Pathfinder setting in beautiful detail."
