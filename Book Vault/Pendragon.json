      "Pendragon is set amidst the glory and grandeur of King Arthur’s Britain. Its innovative mechanics drive the emotional impact of play as your characters pursue Glory, overcome life-and-death struggles, cross blades with ruthless enemies, and fight for love and justice in a world of brutal medieval realism.",
      "The Pendragon: Core Rulebook contains everything you need to begin an epic adventure in King Arthur’s Britain. It covers the complete core rules of the Pendragon game system, including Traits and Passions, Skills, combat, injury and recovery, Glory, Favors, and Honor.",
      "The Pendragon: Core Rulebook serves as a guide to the world of Arthurian fantasy. The book includes a detailed look at England as it was in the time of King Arthur, the fantastical elements of the legendary setting, as well as the role of knights and nobility.",
      "Pendragon campaigns are generational: you will grow old, you may marry, you may have children, and when you die (by the sword or the slow decay of time), you resume play as your heir! The Pendragon: Core Rulebooks contains rules for The Winter Phase—the downtime period of the game for characters to train, age, and even go on side quests.",
      "The book includes a myriad of additional features, including 6 pre-generated character templates for optional, faster character creation, special rules for Afflictions, Obsessions, Directed Traits, Ideals, and ransoms, a full medieval equipment list, and a Coat of Arms generator to make wholly unique heraldry for your Player-knight."

    "This is a game of Arthurian legends.",
    "Do you believe in chivalry, or do you think might always makes right? Are you willing to die for your Honor? Will you fight to rid the world of injustice, or use clout and power to take advantage of those beneath you?",
    "Pendragon is a world of brutal medieval realism, that focuses on the emotional impact of play, and strives to make the players feel as invested, loving, and frightened about their characters as their characters themselves would feel. Pendragon is a game that walks a fine line between lethal reality, and the idealism of a visionary life dedicated to the highest values."
